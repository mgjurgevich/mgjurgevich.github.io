				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m thrilled that I met my $5,000 fundraising goal this week! With 13 days to go, I&#8217;m eager to continue raising even more vital funds for Healthworks Community Fitness and reach the marathon team&#8217;s overall goal of $30,000. </p>
<p>Receiving a donation really is a huge boost of motivation and I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to everyone that&#8217;s taken the time to contribute and express their support. The dollars raised by the marathon team will be a very significant portion of the total donations that HCF receives this year, which is what makes being part of the <a href="http://www.johnhancock.com/bostonmarathon/bostonmarathon_nonprofit.html">John Hancock Non-Profit Marathon Program</a> such a big deal. </p>
<p>It also means that each donation has significant impact on HCF&#8217;s two Dorchester community fitness centers and numerous programs for the health and well-being of women and children in need. </p>
<p>As an advisory board member, I&#8217;m hopeful that this will be the first of many years in which HCF is granted numbers&#8211;I know I certainly couldn&#8217;t imagine a better organization to run and fundraise for!   </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to believe that there are less than 7 weeks until the Boston Marathon. I&#8217;ve come a long way since I <a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/2012/11/im-running-the-2013-boston-marathon/">accepted</a> my spot on the Healthworks Community Fitness Marathon Team in November, but my stomach still does a flip when I think about how quickly April will arrive. </p>
<p>In December, I had more than a few sleepless nights thinking about <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/marisag/">fundraising</a> $5,000, and while I&#8217;m now sleeping much more soundly, it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m at ease with the amount of money I&#8217;ve raised (I&#8217;m not), but rather, because my body is just so tired. Day or night, much of my anxiety now comes from thinking about the actual marathon running. </p>
<p>Going from running 4 miles to 16 in just 11 weeks is a pretty good feeling, and thinking about that accomplishment keeps my hopes high for getting up to 26 miles over the next 6 weeks. As the long runs have increased, so have my feelings of bliss when I&#8217;ve completed them. But, that hasn&#8217;t come without a fair share of increasingly heavy legs, aches, and pains.</p>
<p>This week the HCF team ran 13 miles with Marathon Coalition, a recovery distance to get ready for the next push upward. I felt lighter all week knowing I&#8217;d only have to run a half marathon on Saturday morning, which is truly a thought I never saw coming and another reassuring indication of how I&#8217;ve far I&#8217;ve come.   </p>
<p>Before we headed out, MC <a href="http://bostonmarathoncoach.wordpress.com/about/">Coach Rick Muhr</a> reminded us of how little training time is left, just 2 more long runs (19 and 21 miles) before they taper, but that even when the distance decreases, every run counts until April 15. He said a lot of runners take the shorter runs too lightly, thinking <em>only</em> 13 miles and running them too quickly, which, after months of training, creates the perfect conditions for injury.</p>
<p>To my extreme surprise (and after adamantly thinking that&#8217;s not me during Rick&#8217;s talk), I fell right into that trap today and averaged a pace a good 20-25 seconds faster than any other of my long runs. I&#8217;m crediting that to the fact that it was the warmest (40 degrees), sunniest, and all around most pleasant Saturday morning I&#8217;ve run on, but, I&#8217;ve learned my lesson. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/half-marathon.jpg"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/half-marathon.jpg" alt="half marathon" width="470" height="313" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340" /></a></p>
<p>After 13.25 miles of the same Wellesley Hills we ran last week, I was far more red-faced, achy, and tired than I&#8217;ve been in weeks prior&#8211;a feeling I haven&#8217;t quite kicked all day. The bliss of being done has been subdued by a bothersome left knee and quick realization that 19 miles is less than a week away. Thankfully, I have a foam roller, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GLrKr54yA0/">advice</a> from <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a>, and ample reason to get some serious mental and physical rest before next Saturday. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year, the Boston Athletic Association (the folks who put on the Boston Marathon) gives a limited number of runner entries to local non-profits. Like a marathoner covets her qualification for and entry in the Boston Marathon, local charities and organizations covet the entries they have to give out.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, I accepted an offer to run my very first marathon for <a href="http://healthworkscommunityfitness.org">Healthworks Community Fitness</a> on their <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/marisag">2013 Boston Marathon Team</a>.</p>
<p>Healthworks Community Fitness is an organization very close to my heart. I’m on the advisory board, where I volunteer my time to help push the organization forward. This is the first time in 10 years that HCF has been granted marathon numbers. It’s a big deal. They’re not there to just be handed out to people involved with organizations.</p>
<p>Accepting my place on HCF’s marathon team comes with an obligation to raise a lot of money: $5,000. I need your <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/marisag">help</a> do this. That is, I need your help to help Healthworks Community Fitness, which already does so much with so little.</p>
<p>HCF’s two fitness centers in Dorchester provide safe places for women and children to exercise. Programs such as wellness coaching, nutrition counseling, Zumba, yoga, and other group exercise classes thrive, giving members the knowledge and encouragement to change their health and well-being for the better.</p>
<p>Your support is critical to all the great things HCF does. I’m proud to be running on the Healthworks Community Fitness Team, in support of this organization that means so much to me and so much to the women and children it helps lead healthier lives.</p>
<p>Over the coming months, I’ll post to this blog about my training, as I change my exercise and nutrition habits, and <em>run a lot</em>, and about my fundraising for Healthworks, providing insight into what HCF helps women and children in Dorchester do every day.</p>
<p>See you at the finish line,</p>
<p>Marisa</p>
