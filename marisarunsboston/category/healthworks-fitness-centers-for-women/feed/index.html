				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 11 Marathon Strong sessions, it&#8217;s clear that the program has been invaluable to the HCF team&#8217;s overall success in training for Boston. We&#8217;ve not only learned A LOT about form and stride, warming up, stretching, foam rolling, and injuries, but have also been incredibly supported by <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/clubs/back-bay/">Healthworks Back Bay</a> personal trainer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a>. </p>
<p>Most training sessions have started with a round of 20 questions, which Jason has handled with quite a bit of patience toward the three of us first time marathon runners, he&#8217;s also given up many of his Saturday mornings to run with us and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.416246778465139.1073741827.104933796263107&amp;type=1/">provide water stops</a>, and most recently, has even offered to drop us off at the Boston Marathon starting line, which is in Hopkinton&#8211;26 miles away. (This would save us from boarding buses to Hopkinton in the Boston Common at 7:00am and waiting there until our 10:40am start time.)</p>
<p>At less than 5 weeks until the big day(!), now is the time when many first time marathon runners pick up a few injuries, me and the HCF team included. What I&#8217;ve realized over these last couple of weeks of particularly irritating knee/IT band pain is that without my team and trainer I&#8217;d be pretty discouraged and lost. There&#8217;s so much information about running out there, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to decipher. </p>
<p>After reading a few articles about IT bands the other night, I&#8217;d had enough, and couldn&#8217;t imagine having to rely on any of them for an answer or hint as to what the actual problem might be. I also realized, after reading bits from the comments sections, that my pain would be a whole lot worse without Marathon Strong. It seemed like many of the commentators didn&#8217;t really know the first thing about form, core strength, and stretching&#8211;things that I wouldn&#8217;t have a clue about either.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we&#8217;ve been working on each of these aspects progressively&#8211;each lunge, hip flexor stretch, plank, squat, 30 seconds of running in place, foam roll, and circuit, painful as certain segments has been, has had a pretty meaningful purpose. I&#8217;ve become more attuned than ever to how and why my legs are feeling a certain a way&#8211;and when I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m surrounded by a wealth of knowledge on the HCF team.</p>

Just when nearly all traces of Nemo had disappeared, I was more than disappointed to put on my snow boots this morning. After living in New England for 4 years, I&#8217;ve come to dread the month of February, which, after undergoing up to 4 months of rain, wind, freeze, and snow,  always feels like the longest, coldest, and most miserable month of the year. When it snows in March, it&#8217;s like winter is squeezing lemon on the wounds it inflicted December-February. Dramatic, yes, but from the sad looks on my fellow commuters faces this morning, it&#8217;s not that far from true. </p>
<p>Although it may not sound like it, I think I&#8217;ve handled the cold pretty well this year. But after hours of running in below freezing temperatures, snow, wind, and through ankle deep puddles, not to mention dealing with all of the above on a daily basis when I&#8217;m not running, I&#8217;ve had enough. I&#8217;ll manage on the short, leisurely run I planned on from work to Marathon Strong training at <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/clubs/back-bay/">Healthworks</a> tonight, it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/178937188">19 miles</a> of slippery sidewalks and roads I&#8217;ll be navigating on Saturday that I&#8217;m (even more) nervous about.   </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m not much of a treadmill runner. Although I occasionally enjoy being able to watch the news or thirty minutes of a bad movie I’d never see outside of <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com">Healthworks</a>, I still find it incredibly boring. I can’t help but look down at the time nearly every fifteen seconds or maintain a comfortable temperature, leaving me bright red, drenched in sweat, and a little more confused about the vampire/werewolf hype when I step off the treadmill. </p>
<p>This week has been a particularly cold one in Boston. Wednesday, at it’s peak, the temperature was 16 degrees. When the end of my workday rolled around, putting on my running gear was hard. Knowing I had 6 miles ahead of me, deciding whether to face the treadmill or pavement was even harder. </p>
<p>But when I thought about commuting 50 minutes to the gym and then sweating for an hour on the treadmill versus the bitter cold I would face while running directly home for an hour, it was an easy choice. On foot, I&#8217;d be done in 60 minutes. </p>
<p>I was one of four runners and two bikers on the Charles River Bike path between the Boston University Bridge and Mountain Auburn hospital that evening. Ordinarily when seeing runners out on such frigid days, all I can think is: why? Can’t you take a day off? But on Wednesday evening, I finally understood the answer. No, or at least not when you’re training for the Boston marathon in Boston. </p>
<p>Despite some discomfort to my face&#8211;my eyes, near frozen contact lenses, and chapped lips in particular, it really wasn’t so bad out there. After ten minutes, I wasn’t exactly warm but I wasn’t freezing, and for 2-3 miles my pace was 30 seconds to a minute faster than usual.  </p>
<p>Running in the bitter cold feels much better than waiting for a bus in it. More importantly, now that I’ve run an hour in the teens, I’ll be ready for 2 hours in the low twenties this weekend. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/2013/01/marathonstrong3/photo1-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-153"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Photo1-431x1024.jpg" alt="Photo1" width="431" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-153" /></a></p>
<p>Sue, Paula, and I started this week’s Marathon Strong training session off by filling out our 2013 B.A.A. Boston Marathon registration forms, an exciting and surreal process. Since the entries are a pretty valuable commodity to come by, Lauren had given us specific instructions earlier in the week to fill the forms out perfectly. Thankfully we all completed them without any snafus, and we’re now officially committed to fundraising and running 26.2 miles for Healthworks Community Fitness! </p>
<p>During the training session Jason taught us a number of running drills to help us make our form and stride more efficient during the many miles ahead. After warming up with a few laps of lunges and karaokes, the first important step was setting our posture with knees slightly bent, hips forward, and hands above the head. The drills we learned were: hopping in place, to practice landing on the balls of our feet;  figure 4, pulling the foot up like it’s running along a rail on the other leg; and figure 4 at a pace of 180-190 beats per minute, landing as softly as possible. </p>
<p>After practicing them in place for a few minutes, we learned how easy moving forward actually feels thanks to gravity and a slight lean from the ankles. After two 5 minute circuits of combinations of lunges with a kettlebell, side planks, hopping in place, figure 4s, and karaokes, my heart rate was up and hamstrings were burning, all with good reason of course. Part of the lesson was also about getting us to reach a plateau and then recover&#8211;similar to how we’ll be feeling on and after Heartbreak Hill. </p>
<p>I was amazed during my five mile run the next evening when I could already feel how different my stride felt when I focused on the techniques we learned. My long run this weekend was just seven miles, which is recovery after nearly 10 last Sunday, with that and more drill practice I’ll be refreshed and ready for 12 next Saturday.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Led by Back Bay personal trainer and HCF volunteer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a>, the HCF team is participating in Marathon Strong, a running-specific progressive group training program that focuses on injury prevention, increasing performance, and improving running form. </p>
<p>I used to be a regular “straight up strength” class attendee, but it’s likely been 6 months or so since I’ve attended one of Healthworks many challenging group fitness <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/group-fitness/">classes</a>. So after (what I now realize) was a fairly introductory small group training session last Thursday, week two was quite the challenge.  </p>
<p>We started with five minutes on the elliptical, the dynamic stretches we learned last week, and then jumped into a circuit program. My first stop was a plank, which I’m guessing was 60-90 seconds. From there it was a cable cross, working both sides of the core. The last, and my least favorite, stop was a two foot block, 15 pound weight, and a lot of stepping up, knee lifting, and burn. </p>
<p>After three rounds and a very brief break, we all kicked off the second circuit with two and half minutes of rotating between planks and side planks. My first stop was a balance/squat/core-cross-over-with-a-medicine-ball exercise. I then moved on to the TRX suspension training row, which involved pulling myself up with two feet on the ground from handles hanging from the ceiling, and quite a bit of soreness in my shoulders. And finally, dead lifts with a twenty pound medicine ball. Two rounds later, I was certainly tired, sweaty, and thankful that I was just another minute plank and handful of stretches away from being finished. </p>
<p>I walked down Boylston Street feeling energized, and woke up without too many sore muscles. But, since Marathon Strong&#8217;s a progressive training program, I might start fearing my Thursday evenings a tiny bit more.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a week of cross country and west coast travel, the flu has taken its toll on me. My time with family and friends in Portland, Seattle, and southern California was all well spent, it’s the nearly 20 hours on 4 airplanes that I could have done without. I landed in Boston on Sunday evening congested, chilled, and achy, and haven’t moved too far from my apartment since then. </p>
<p>In between a lot of sleeping, I started to get especially nervous thinking about how far behind I was falling in my training. The marathon was 15 weeks from Monday, and my training plan officially started 16 weeks out. Now that it’s January, April 15 feels really soon. But when walking a quarter mile to Harvard Square was exhausting, I knew I wouldn’t be getting much running in this week. </p>
<p>Just thinking about how much I haven’t run wasn’t doing me any favors, so I forced myself to reexamine my training plans. To my relief, I’m really not too far behind. Sure missing three 4-mile runs this week isn’t something I can do again, but as long as I stick to the schedule, starting with 7 miles tomorrow, I’ll be okay. Running is mostly mental, so I’m counting on my pre-16 week milage to help make up for what I’ve most recently missed. </p>
<p>I didn’t want to miss out on my first marathon team training session this week and mustered up the energy to get to Healthworks Back Bay last night. Luckily, Jason took it fairly easy on us in covering some fundamental strengthening exercises. After a few minute jog on the treadmill, we spent the rest of the hour learning and practicing key stretches that make up a dynamic warm up, as well as foundation exercises such as squats, planks, and hip hinges. </p>
<p>I had done most of these exercises before, but having each movement explained in terms of how it helps align posture, build core strength, and/or improve running form was new and really useful. We’re expected to practice and perfect each stretch and exercise before our next training session&#8211;the dynamic warm-up will be especially helpful before I go out for 7 miles tomorrow. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week I attended my first Healthworks Community Fitness marathon team meeting with fellow runners Sue and Paula, our trainer Jason Sibley-Liddle, and HCF executive director <a href="http://healthworkscommunityfitness.org/staff">Lauren Broadhurst</a>. Sue, Paula, and I are all first time marathoners and shared mutual excitement and nervousness for the training ahead. Fortunately, we’re in good hands. </p>
<p>Over the next five months we’ll be meeting weekly at <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com">Healthworks Fitness Centers for Women</a> (HCF’s corporate founder) for a specialized group fitness program with Jason, who is a certified personal trainer at HW Back Bay, triathlete, and HCF volunteer. I’ve never worked with a trainer before, so I’m particularly excited to get much needed feedback on form, strength training, nutrition, and more. Another team perk is a free Healthworks membership through April, which I hope to use more so for yoga classes than 15+ mile treadmill runs. </p>
<p>As HCF marathon team members, we’re also expected to help with community outreach. Lauren gave us a thorough and inspiring overview of the organization’s history, highlighting relationships with community health centers that prescribe HCF memberships to their patients, and services such as free childcare, wellness coaching, and subsidized membership rates that encourage women of all fitness and income levels to join and fully utilize HCF.</p>
<div id="attachment_29" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 615px"><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HCF_timeline.png"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HCF_timeline.png" alt="" title="HCF_timeline" width="605" height="421" class="size-full wp-image-29" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Healthworks Community Fitness&#8217; timeline and evolution</p></div>
<p>She also told us about our other teammate from Idaho, Mike Erhedt, a <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/mike/">Hyland’s Masters Athlete</a> and seasoned marathon runner&#8211;he ran one a day for eleven weeks in 2010. </p>
<p>Later this month we’ll have the chance to meet him and fellow Masters Athlete <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/michelle/">Michelle</a> when they visit HCF at Codman to coach a running clinic. They’re starting a club for HCF members to train and complete the Boston Athletic Association’s 5K, which is the day before the Boston Marathon. This will be a big feat for many of the participants, and I’m looking forward to meeting them soon. </p>
