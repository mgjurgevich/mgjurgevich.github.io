			<p>I couldn&#8217;t have thought of a better way to get my final 2 training miles in than at the HCF 5K this morning. Despite the cold weather&#8211;the temperature didn&#8217;t get above 40 degrees&#8211;an eager crowd still made it to the Hatchshell to get a 3 mile run, walk, or walk/run in. Seeing and feeling the enthusiasm among HCF members along the course and at the finish line was a joy.</p>
<p>It was also yet another reminder why I’m so proud to be running on the Healthworks Community Fitness Team, in support of an organization that means so much to me and so much to the women and children it helps lead healthier lives.</p>

<p>After a foot of snow was dumped on Boston on Thursday and Friday, 19 miles didn&#8217;t seem too promising this Saturday. Since Marathon Coalition&#8217;s planned Wellesley-Newton route has still had traces of Nemo during the last two weeks of running, with a fresh 12 inches we decided that the plowed Charles River Esplanade was a safer and more reliable option. Jason kindly met me, Sue, and fellow Marathon Strong trainee <a href= "http://rebeccarunsboston.wordpress.com">Rebecca</a> on the Cambridge side of the Mass. Ave. bridge at 9am yesterday morning to root us on and provide water stops throughout our 18 miler. </p>
<p>While the Esplanade wasn&#8217;t exactly free of snow, it was doable with caution and a slower pace. To my extreme disappointment, my left knee was in quite a bit of pain after just over 3 miles and, after conferring with the team at our first water stop, I decided to part ways for a very slow 2 miles home. </p>
<p>After spending some quality time with my IT band on the foam roller and ice on my knee, I got baking&#8211;if I couldn&#8217;t do the physical training, I could at least work on the nutritional part of it. </p>
<p>Over the last few months of a little trial and error while loosely following this <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/granola-bars-recipe/index.html">recipe</a>, I&#8217;ve nearly perfected homemade granola bars. My first few attempts left me with very few bars, but quite a bit of, still delicious, granola. </p>
<p>The game changer in texture has been the <a href="http://localroot.com/USA-Pan-9-Square-Cake-Pan.html">9&#215;9 USA Pan</a> I picked up at <a href="http://localroot.com">Local Root</a>, in taste, it&#8217;s been substituting vanilla extract for almond. I also use part almond butter, part stick. And though I usually use the cheap stuff from the bulk aisle, quality honey goes a long way. </p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-1.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-1.jpg" alt="granola 1" width="470" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-362" /></a></p>
<p>I start by pulsing 2 cups of mixed nuts in a food processor. Add that to 2 cups of oats and bake at 350 for 15 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-2.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-2-470x330.jpg" alt="granola 2" width="470" height="330" class="aligncenter size-singular-thumbnail wp-image-364" /></a></p>
<p>While the oat/nut mixture is in the oven, combine the butter, almond butter, honey, brown sugar, almond extract, and salt, slowly melting it on the stove. I don&#8217;t really follow Alton&#8217;s measurements with the wet ingredients, but eyeball it when it&#8217;s time to add the oats, nuts, and dried fruit. </p>
<p>Once the dry ingredients are evenly coated, press into a buttered pan, and bake at 300 for 25 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-3.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-3.jpg" alt="granola 3" width="470" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367" /></a></p>
<p>The tricky part is cutting, but I&#8217;ve recently found that getting the entire bar out of the pan while still slightly warm and then cutting has better results. </p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-4.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-4.jpg" alt="granola 4" width="470" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much less expensive, more delicious and nutritious homemade granola bars are than what you find in boxes on grocery store shelves. They may not heal my knee, but, for now, they&#8217;ll help during the week of recovery ahead. </p>

Just when nearly all traces of Nemo had disappeared, I was more than disappointed to put on my snow boots this morning. After living in New England for 4 years, I&#8217;ve come to dread the month of February, which, after undergoing up to 4 months of rain, wind, freeze, and snow,  always feels like the longest, coldest, and most miserable month of the year. When it snows in March, it&#8217;s like winter is squeezing lemon on the wounds it inflicted December-February. Dramatic, yes, but from the sad looks on my fellow commuters faces this morning, it&#8217;s not that far from true. </p>
<p>Although it may not sound like it, I think I&#8217;ve handled the cold pretty well this year. But after hours of running in below freezing temperatures, snow, wind, and through ankle deep puddles, not to mention dealing with all of the above on a daily basis when I&#8217;m not running, I&#8217;ve had enough. I&#8217;ll manage on the short, leisurely run I planned on from work to Marathon Strong training at <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/clubs/back-bay/">Healthworks</a> tonight, it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/178937188">19 miles</a> of slippery sidewalks and roads I&#8217;ll be navigating on Saturday that I&#8217;m (even more) nervous about.   </p>

			<p>It’s hard to believe that there are less than 7 weeks until the Boston Marathon. I&#8217;ve come a long way since I <a href="../../index.html%3Fp=1.html">accepted</a> my spot on the Healthworks Community Fitness Marathon Team in November, but my stomach still does a flip when I think about how quickly April will arrive. </p>
<p>In December, I had more than a few sleepless nights thinking about <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/marisag/">fundraising</a> $5,000, and while I&#8217;m now sleeping much more soundly, it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m at ease with the amount of money I&#8217;ve raised (I&#8217;m not), but rather, because my body is just so tired. Day or night, much of my anxiety now comes from thinking about the actual marathon running. </p>
<p>Going from running 4 miles to 16 in just 11 weeks is a pretty good feeling, and thinking about that accomplishment keeps my hopes high for getting up to 26 miles over the next 6 weeks. As the long runs have increased, so have my feelings of bliss when I&#8217;ve completed them. But, that hasn&#8217;t come without a fair share of increasingly heavy legs, aches, and pains.</p>
<p>This week the HCF team ran 13 miles with Marathon Coalition, a recovery distance to get ready for the next push upward. I felt lighter all week knowing I&#8217;d only have to run a half marathon on Saturday morning, which is truly a thought I never saw coming and another reassuring indication of how I&#8217;ve far I&#8217;ve come.   </p>
<p>Before we headed out, MC <a href="http://bostonmarathoncoach.wordpress.com/about/">Coach Rick Muhr</a> reminded us of how little training time is left, just 2 more long runs (19 and 21 miles) before they taper, but that even when the distance decreases, every run counts until April 15. He said a lot of runners take the shorter runs too lightly, thinking <em>only</em> 13 miles and running them too quickly, which, after months of training, creates the perfect conditions for injury.</p>
<p>To my extreme surprise (and after adamantly thinking that&#8217;s not me during Rick&#8217;s talk), I fell right into that trap today and averaged a pace a good 20-25 seconds faster than any other of my long runs. I&#8217;m crediting that to the fact that it was the warmest (40 degrees), sunniest, and all around most pleasant Saturday morning I&#8217;ve run on, but, I&#8217;ve learned my lesson. </p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/half-marathon.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/half-marathon.jpg" alt="half marathon" width="470" height="313" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340" /></a></p>
<p>After 13.25 miles of the same Wellesley Hills we ran last week, I was far more red-faced, achy, and tired than I&#8217;ve been in weeks prior&#8211;a feeling I haven&#8217;t quite kicked all day. The bliss of being done has been subdued by a bothersome left knee and quick realization that 19 miles is less than a week away. Thankfully, I have a foam roller, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GLrKr54yA0/">advice</a> from <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a>, and ample reason to get some serious mental and physical rest before next Saturday. </p>

<p>Over the last six weeks, I’ve been running between 3 and 7 miles Tuesday through Thursday. Running home from work has been a wonderful way to get that mileage in. I get home faster than my regular bus to train commute, avoid traffic and other irritations of public transportation, and, overall, just feel better once I reach my front door. </p>
<p>Boston is a small city that often takes a frustratingly long time to navigate. I don’t own a car, but over four years here my desire for one has decreased, parallel parking and shoveling 25+ inches of snow are just a couple of reasons for that. But mainly, I don’t need one. </p>
<p>The last eight months, however, have really tested my love for the MBTA. Commuting to my newish office, less than 4 miles from my home, takes between 40 and 60 minutes each way, sometimes longer, very rarely shorter. Spending that much time on or waiting for buses or trains twice a day started to wear on me pretty quickly. </p>
<p>I’d walked home from work a few times over the summer, but it was usually a last minute decision, usually when I realized there was a Red Sox game and knew I’d be better off on foot, and it wasn’t really a welcomed alternative or appreciated the same way that running has been. That’s mainly because walking didn’t actually get me home any faster, but partially because I didn’t feel like I had to do it. </p>
<p>Exercising 5 days a week has been a big adjustment and challenge, and I’m actually not sure if it’s something I had ever done before I began training. But after 6 weeks of running home 2 or 3 evenings a week, I’m hooked, as well as convinced that it’s the best way to exercise (and commute) now and beyond April 15.</p>
<p>Cambridge (home) and Boston (work) are divided by the Charles River, and the surrounding bike path and handful of pedestrian friendly bridges are ideal for covering the majority of the 3.5 miles between. Even on the coldest or most tiring days, I know I’ll warm up faster and feel better than I would waiting for and on the bus. And although it’s not really getting any warmer, it’s staying lighter later, at the perfect time, just as I begin more 8-10 mile midweek runs. But, I do have a <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/843412/nathan-headgasket-headband-with-leds/">earwarmer-headlamp</a> for darker evenings, bikers being a bigger worry than cars. </p>
<p>Sadly, the biggest barrier to running home just arrived over the weekend&#8211;5 foot snow banks don’t create very welcoming sidewalks or bike paths, but I’m crossing my fingers for enough melting and plowing today to help that problem. I’d certainly rather run through puddles than face another nearly 3 hours of trains tomorrow. </p>

			<p>I’m not much of a treadmill runner. Although I occasionally enjoy being able to watch the news or thirty minutes of a bad movie I’d never see outside of <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com">Healthworks</a>, I still find it incredibly boring. I can’t help but look down at the time nearly every fifteen seconds or maintain a comfortable temperature, leaving me bright red, drenched in sweat, and a little more confused about the vampire/werewolf hype when I step off the treadmill. </p>
<p>This week has been a particularly cold one in Boston. Wednesday, at it’s peak, the temperature was 16 degrees. When the end of my workday rolled around, putting on my running gear was hard. Knowing I had 6 miles ahead of me, deciding whether to face the treadmill or pavement was even harder. </p>
<p>But when I thought about commuting 50 minutes to the gym and then sweating for an hour on the treadmill versus the bitter cold I would face while running directly home for an hour, it was an easy choice. On foot, I&#8217;d be done in 60 minutes. </p>
<p>I was one of four runners and two bikers on the Charles River Bike path between the Boston University Bridge and Mountain Auburn hospital that evening. Ordinarily when seeing runners out on such frigid days, all I can think is: why? Can’t you take a day off? But on Wednesday evening, I finally understood the answer. No, or at least not when you’re training for the Boston marathon in Boston. </p>
<p>Despite some discomfort to my face&#8211;my eyes, near frozen contact lenses, and chapped lips in particular, it really wasn’t so bad out there. After ten minutes, I wasn’t exactly warm but I wasn’t freezing, and for 2-3 miles my pace was 30 seconds to a minute faster than usual.  </p>
<p>Running in the bitter cold feels much better than waiting for a bus in it. More importantly, now that I’ve run an hour in the teens, I’ll be ready for 2 hours in the low twenties this weekend. </p>

During and after my run, I wasn’t really thinking about how much further I need to go. I was thinking about how cold it&#8217;s going to get.</span></p>
<p>On Thursday, it was fifty degrees and sunny: near perfect running conditions. Over the next five days, the daily highs rarely go much over forty. Needless to say I&#8217;m not encouraged by the fact that Winter is still technically a month away.</p>
<p>Yesterday, running with the sun shining brightly, leaves still on some of the trees and more crunching beneath my feet, I felt really happy to be outside, taking in such a beautiful day. It made running the furthest I have in a while easy and enjoyable. Imagining doing the same with snow, ice, and slush in place of late fall&#8217;s discarded foliage is hard.</p>
<p>I can’t deny that I&#8217;m uneasy about getting out there for two and three times that distance in the depths of winter. But I am hopeful that the most difficult of my <em>initial</em> efforts in getting back into shape will happen over the next month, when I’ll be able to enjoy at least a handful of pretty-warm-for-November/December days.</p>
