<p>As of  Sunday, 12 miles is the furthest I’ve ever run. Before I headed out I was thinking back to the last time I ran <em>nearly</em> 12 miles. To my surprise, I realized it had been over 7 years since that October day in Washington, D.C. when my sister and I ran the “Army 10-miler.” I found myself back in the same routine that we started our race day with&#8211;chugging water, eating toast, and asking myself: am I ready for this? Similar to that morning, I felt mixed. </p>
<p>Shortly after I accepted my position on the HCF team, a friend asked when I thought training would start to get <em>really</em> hard. My response:  anything over 11.25, because that was unknown territory. </p>
<p>The year my sister and I ran the 10-miler, the course was actually rerouted mid-race because of a bomb scare on the 14th Street Bridge, something I didn’t learn until I crossed the finish line. I was frustrated and tired at the end, as well as upset that I would never receive an official time, albeit that was mainly due to a little sibling rivalry and never having proof of running faster than my sister. But, I did it&#8211;something I’m much more glad about today than I was in October 2005. </p>
<p>And there’s a lesson from that day that I’ll be grateful for throughout the many more miles of training ahead, and that’s knowing that I can always push myself a little a bit further. If you set out for ten, 12+ won’t be a problem, and if you’ve run 12 before, 13 will be a breeze. Run 20 miles? Well then, of course you can run 26. Or at least I hope. </p>
<p>Running is all mental. And as I’m sure I’ll continue to express here, I play a lot of tricks on my brain to get out there and pound the pavement. When it’s 28 degrees outside and I delay, for as long as possible, heading on a 2+ hour run, the more encouragement I have the better. That’s always come from telling myself: you’ve done this, of course you can do it again. </p>
<p>Moving forward, I’ll need to slightly alter my strategy, and the memory of completing the Army 10-but actually 11.25-miler is a nice way to do so. Next weekend I’ll enter into more unknown territory, 13 miles, a distance I’ll certainly be ready for after 12.2. </p>

<p>Today I ran 5.5 miles, the furthest I’ve run in years. I’ve had the idea to run the route I ran today in the back of my mind for awhile, but without a real reason to go further than my normal 20-30 minutes, I haven’t. </p>
<p>Shortly after I moved to Cambridge, I found out that the path around the Fresh Pond reservoir covered about 3 miles. Getting there from my apartment is just over a mile, so it always sounded like the ideal 5-mile run. I’m in the area often&#8211;grocery shopping nearby almost weekly, but I had never stepped foot on the path until today. </p>
<p>Running Fresh Pond feels like a big feat, after all this time thinking about it, I’m glad I finally made it there. It’s a lovely loop that I plan to take multiple laps around in the coming weeks. There are number of offshooting trails to mix up the scenery, and, more importantly, plenty of cute dogs to keep me entertained for hours. </p>
