				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After writing about making my amended <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/granola-bars-recipe/index.html">Alton Brown</a> granola bars last week, I figured I should include my own (nearly perfected) recipe. I&#8217;ll definitely be making and eating a batch of these before my 21 mile run on Saturday!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">2 cups oats</span></li>
<li>2 cups mixed nuts (+ an optional dash of hemp or flax seeds)</li>
<li>1/4 cup honey</li>
<li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
<li>2-4 tbsp butter</li>
<li>1/3 cup almond or peanut butter</li>
<li>1 tbsp almond extract</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 cup dried fruit</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-397" alt="granola 2" src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-21.jpg" width="470" height="470" /></a><br />
<strong>Method</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350. Butter <a href="http://localroot.com/USA-Pan-9-Square-Cake-Pan.html">9&#215;9-inch pan</a>.</li>
<li>Combine chopped nuts with oats, spread onto a cookie sheet and toast in oven for 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes or so.</li>
<li>Mix honey, brown sugar, butters, extract and salt in a saucepan over low-medium heat and cook until brown sugar has dissolved.</li>
<li>When the oats/nuts have toasted, remove and decrease the oven temperature to 300 degrees.</li>
<li>Combine oats/nuts with dried fruit and then add to the wet mixture, stirring until all dry ingredients are evenly coated. (I usually leave the heat on very low during this part and add extra butters and/or honey if neccesary.)</li>
<li>Spread mixture into buttered pan, pressing on it with a spatula to even it out. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and allow bar to almost completelyÂ cool.</li>
<li>Cut into squares in the pan, or if you can get it out, remove the whole bar and cut it into squares on a cutting board.</li>
<li>Once the squares are completely cool, store them in an airtight container in the pantry or fridge for a week or so. If some (or all) of your bars crumbled, save that to top yogurt or ice cream, or to eat by the handful.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/snow.jpg"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/snow-400x230.jpg" alt="snow" width="400" height="230" class="aligncenter size-singular-gallery-thumbnail wp-image-374" /></a></p>
<p>After a foot of snow was dumped on Boston on Thursday and Friday, 19 miles didn&#8217;t seem too promising this Saturday. Since Marathon Coalition&#8217;s planned Wellesley-Newton route has still had traces of Nemo during the last two weeks of running, with a fresh 12 inches we decided that the plowed Charles River Esplanade was a safer and more reliable option. Jason kindly met me, Sue, and fellow Marathon Strong trainee <a href= "http://rebeccarunsboston.wordpress.com">Rebecca</a> on the Cambridge side of the Mass. Ave. bridge at 9am yesterday morning to root us on and provide water stops throughout our 18 miler. </p>
<p>While the Esplanade wasn&#8217;t exactly free of snow, it was doable with caution and a slower pace. To my extreme disappointment, my left knee was in quite a bit of pain after just over 3 miles and, after conferring with the team at our first water stop, I decided to part ways for a very slow 2 miles home. </p>
<p>After spending some quality time with my IT band on the foam roller and ice on my knee, I got baking&#8211;if I couldn&#8217;t do the physical training, I could at least work on the nutritional part of it. </p>
<p>Over the last few months of a little trial and error while loosely following this <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/granola-bars-recipe/index.html">recipe</a>, I&#8217;ve nearly perfected homemade granola bars. My first few attempts left me with very few bars, but quite a bit of, still delicious, granola. </p>
<p>The game changer in texture has been the <a href="http://localroot.com/USA-Pan-9-Square-Cake-Pan.html">9&#215;9 USA Pan</a> I picked up at <a href="http://localroot.com">Local Root</a>, in taste, it&#8217;s been substituting vanilla extract for almond. I also use part almond butter, part stick. And though I usually use the cheap stuff from the bulk aisle, quality honey goes a long way. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-1.jpg"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-1.jpg" alt="granola 1" width="470" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-362" /></a></p>
<p>I start by pulsing 2 cups of mixed nuts in a food processor. Add that to 2 cups of oats and bake at 350 for 15 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-2.jpg"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-2-470x330.jpg" alt="granola 2" width="470" height="330" class="aligncenter size-singular-thumbnail wp-image-364" /></a></p>
<p>While the oat/nut mixture is in the oven, combine the butter, almond butter, honey, brown sugar, almond extract, and salt, slowly melting it on the stove. I don&#8217;t really follow Alton&#8217;s measurements with the wet ingredients, but eyeball it when it&#8217;s time to add the oats, nuts, and dried fruit. </p>
<p>Once the dry ingredients are evenly coated, press into a buttered pan, and bake at 300 for 25 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-3.jpg"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-3.jpg" alt="granola 3" width="470" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367" /></a></p>
<p>The tricky part is cutting, but I&#8217;ve recently found that getting the entire bar out of the pan while still slightly warm and then cutting has better results. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-4.jpg"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-4.jpg" alt="granola 4" width="470" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much less expensive, more delicious and nutritious homemade granola bars are than what you find in boxes on grocery store shelves. They may not heal my knee, but, for now, they&#8217;ll help during the week of recovery ahead. </p>
