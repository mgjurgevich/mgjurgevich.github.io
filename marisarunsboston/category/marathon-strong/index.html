			<p>After 11 Marathon Strong sessions, it&#8217;s clear that the program has been invaluable to the HCF team&#8217;s overall success in training for Boston. We&#8217;ve not only learned A LOT about form and stride, warming up, stretching, foam rolling, and injuries, but have also been incredibly supported by <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/clubs/back-bay/">Healthworks Back Bay</a> personal trainer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a>. </p>
<p>Most training sessions have started with a round of 20 questions, which Jason has handled with quite a bit of patience toward the three of us first time marathon runners, he&#8217;s also given up many of his Saturday mornings to run with us and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.416246778465139.1073741827.104933796263107&amp;type=1/">provide water stops</a>, and most recently, has even offered to drop us off at the Boston Marathon starting line, which is in Hopkinton&#8211;26 miles away. (This would save us from boarding buses to Hopkinton in the Boston Common at 7:00am and waiting there until our 10:40am start time.)</p>
<p>At less than 5 weeks until the big day(!), now is the time when many first time marathon runners pick up a few injuries, me and the HCF team included. What I&#8217;ve realized over these last couple of weeks of particularly irritating knee/IT band pain is that without my team and trainer I&#8217;d be pretty discouraged and lost. There&#8217;s so much information about running out there, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to decipher. </p>
<p>After reading a few articles about IT bands the other night, I&#8217;d had enough, and couldn&#8217;t imagine having to rely on any of them for an answer or hint as to what the actual problem might be. I also realized, after reading bits from the comments sections, that my pain would be a whole lot worse without Marathon Strong. It seemed like many of the commentators didn&#8217;t really know the first thing about form, core strength, and stretching&#8211;things that I wouldn&#8217;t have a clue about either.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we&#8217;ve been working on each of these aspects progressively&#8211;each lunge, hip flexor stretch, plank, squat, 30 seconds of running in place, foam roll, and circuit, painful as certain segments has been, has had a pretty meaningful purpose. I&#8217;ve become more attuned than ever to how and why my legs are feeling a certain a way&#8211;and when I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m surrounded by a wealth of knowledge on the HCF team.</p>

<p>After a foot of snow was dumped on Boston on Thursday and Friday, 19 miles didn&#8217;t seem too promising this Saturday. Since Marathon Coalition&#8217;s planned Wellesley-Newton route has still had traces of Nemo during the last two weeks of running, with a fresh 12 inches we decided that the plowed Charles River Esplanade was a safer and more reliable option. Jason kindly met me, Sue, and fellow Marathon Strong trainee <a href= "http://rebeccarunsboston.wordpress.com">Rebecca</a> on the Cambridge side of the Mass. Ave. bridge at 9am yesterday morning to root us on and provide water stops throughout our 18 miler. </p>
<p>While the Esplanade wasn&#8217;t exactly free of snow, it was doable with caution and a slower pace. To my extreme disappointment, my left knee was in quite a bit of pain after just over 3 miles and, after conferring with the team at our first water stop, I decided to part ways for a very slow 2 miles home. </p>
<p>After spending some quality time with my IT band on the foam roller and ice on my knee, I got baking&#8211;if I couldn&#8217;t do the physical training, I could at least work on the nutritional part of it. </p>
<p>Over the last few months of a little trial and error while loosely following this <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/granola-bars-recipe/index.html">recipe</a>, I&#8217;ve nearly perfected homemade granola bars. My first few attempts left me with very few bars, but quite a bit of, still delicious, granola. </p>
<p>The game changer in texture has been the <a href="http://localroot.com/USA-Pan-9-Square-Cake-Pan.html">9&#215;9 USA Pan</a> I picked up at <a href="http://localroot.com">Local Root</a>, in taste, it&#8217;s been substituting vanilla extract for almond. I also use part almond butter, part stick. And though I usually use the cheap stuff from the bulk aisle, quality honey goes a long way. </p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-1.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-1.jpg" alt="granola 1" width="470" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-362" /></a></p>
<p>I start by pulsing 2 cups of mixed nuts in a food processor. Add that to 2 cups of oats and bake at 350 for 15 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-2.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-2-470x330.jpg" alt="granola 2" width="470" height="330" class="aligncenter size-singular-thumbnail wp-image-364" /></a></p>
<p>While the oat/nut mixture is in the oven, combine the butter, almond butter, honey, brown sugar, almond extract, and salt, slowly melting it on the stove. I don&#8217;t really follow Alton&#8217;s measurements with the wet ingredients, but eyeball it when it&#8217;s time to add the oats, nuts, and dried fruit. </p>
<p>Once the dry ingredients are evenly coated, press into a buttered pan, and bake at 300 for 25 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-3.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-3.jpg" alt="granola 3" width="470" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367" /></a></p>
<p>The tricky part is cutting, but I&#8217;ve recently found that getting the entire bar out of the pan while still slightly warm and then cutting has better results. </p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-4.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-4.jpg" alt="granola 4" width="470" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much less expensive, more delicious and nutritious homemade granola bars are than what you find in boxes on grocery store shelves. They may not heal my knee, but, for now, they&#8217;ll help during the week of recovery ahead. </p>

HCF ED <a href="http://healthworkscommunityfitness.org/staff">Lauren Broadhurst</a> and Marathon Strong trainer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a> kindly attended this Saturday’s 8am Marathon Coalition training to run with and cheer on me and <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/paulasandler">Paula</a>. (<a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a> took the weekend off to give her achy knee a break.) The MC had an 18 mile route mapped out, which was, thankfully, very straightforward since the four of us were all planning on going different lengths.</p>
<p>Paula, fresh off the plane from a business trip in Japan, was running 13; Jason, a day before running the Hyannis Half Marathon was going out for 8; Lauren, who hadn’t run in a few months, didn’t have an exact number in mind; and I was running 16, the furthest I’ve ever gone.</p>
<p>Since I’ve been starting my long runs with miles nearly 2 minutes faster than I’ve been ending them with, I felt like I really needed to work on pacing. Lauren, who once ran 4 marathons in 9 months, agreed and urged me to get into the habit of starting off much more slowly. Lucky for me, she also volunteered to pace me.</p>
<p>We started just near the base of Heartbreak Hill, reversing the course and running west, away from Boston. Lauren ran with me for the first 6 miles, keeping me right on pace at hour 1, and, more importantly, concentrated on conversation rather than time and distance.</p>
<p>After running so many miles solo, talking while running was a bit challenging, but also tremendously helpful. She said my marathon pace shouldn’t be faster than what I can hold a conversation at, and though I’m not convinced I could’ve held one from miles 10-16, I am sure that the first 6 miles of talking really helped me get through the last 6. It’s amazing how a little distraction for an hour can keep you going for another hour and forty.</p>
<p>Between yesterday and last weekend, I’ve now run nearly 10 miles of the course. 3 have been in reverse, but the other 7 have been eye opening. From what I’ve seen and felt so far, Heartbreak Hill is not the only heartbreaker on the course.</p>

After I felt barefoot during a 10 mile run a few weeks ago, I realized it was finally time for a new pair of shoes. Although I couldn’t remember when I last bought running shoes, I hadn’t been too concerned about my feet  considering how minimal my running was prior to marathon training and the mixed <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/when-to-retire-a-running-shoe/">arguments</a> around how long you should wear them. </p>
<p>Although I’m usually pretty particular about shopping, buying fitness gear has never been much of a priority. But, after Jason recommended the <a href="http://www.southendathleticcompany.com">South End Athletic Company&#8217;s</a> gait analysis to the HCF team, and <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a> returned to the next Marathon Strong session with rave reviews and a healed injury, I was actually excited to pick out running shoes.</p>
<p>They really do make buying running shoes easy and informative. I stopped by the store on a weekday afternoon and was quickly handed a minimalist pair of shoes and instructed to hop on the treadmill. An employ video recorded my stride for one minute of running and then reviewed it with me. I live near another running store and see a lot of people awkwardly running down the block while a sales associate watches, something I’ve also done before. My sock choice might have been a bit embarrassing for the video, but running inside the store on a tucked away treadmill and then seeing my gait frame by frame was a much more comfortable and enlightening experience. I could actually see why I should buy a particular shoe. </p>
<p>Like a lot of people, I tend to overpronate, which means that I need a bit of help my to keep my feet stable. SEAC’s shoes are grouped by the amount of support they provide, so I was a bit disappointed to see that the coolest looking shoes ones tend to have the least amount of cushioning (on the left), and that I’d be stuck with another clunky pair of sneakers (to the right). </p>
<p>I tried on a good 4-6 pairs of shoes, in varying brands, sizes, and levels of support. What I liked was that I didn&#8217;t have to make many decisions, and was simply given the best pairs for my gait, which were also all around the same price point. And though I really wanted to go with the slimmer cooler looking choice, I knew I had to go with the more supportive, size bigger, bulky shoe. Thankfully, not many of SEAC&#8217;s choices are white, and I still walked out with the best looking and fitting pair of running shoes (Asics GT2000) I’ve ever bought.</p>

<p>Sue, Paula, and I started this week’s Marathon Strong training session off by filling out our 2013 B.A.A. Boston Marathon registration forms, an exciting and surreal process. Since the entries are a pretty valuable commodity to come by, Lauren had given us specific instructions earlier in the week to fill the forms out perfectly. Thankfully we all completed them without any snafus, and we’re now officially committed to fundraising and running 26.2 miles for Healthworks Community Fitness! </p>
<p>During the training session Jason taught us a number of running drills to help us make our form and stride more efficient during the many miles ahead. After warming up with a few laps of lunges and karaokes, the first important step was setting our posture with knees slightly bent, hips forward, and hands above the head. The drills we learned were: hopping in place, to practice landing on the balls of our feet;  figure 4, pulling the foot up like it’s running along a rail on the other leg; and figure 4 at a pace of 180-190 beats per minute, landing as softly as possible. </p>
<p>After practicing them in place for a few minutes, we learned how easy moving forward actually feels thanks to gravity and a slight lean from the ankles. After two 5 minute circuits of combinations of lunges with a kettlebell, side planks, hopping in place, figure 4s, and karaokes, my heart rate was up and hamstrings were burning, all with good reason of course. Part of the lesson was also about getting us to reach a plateau and then recover&#8211;similar to how we’ll be feeling on and after Heartbreak Hill. </p>
<p>I was amazed during my five mile run the next evening when I could already feel how different my stride felt when I focused on the techniques we learned. My long run this weekend was just seven miles, which is recovery after nearly 10 last Sunday, with that and more drill practice I’ll be refreshed and ready for 12 next Saturday.</p>

			<p>Led by Back Bay personal trainer and HCF volunteer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a>, the HCF team is participating in Marathon Strong, a running-specific progressive group training program that focuses on injury prevention, increasing performance, and improving running form. </p>
<p>I used to be a regular “straight up strength” class attendee, but it’s likely been 6 months or so since I’ve attended one of Healthworks many challenging group fitness <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/group-fitness/">classes</a>. So after (what I now realize) was a fairly introductory small group training session last Thursday, week two was quite the challenge.  </p>
<p>We started with five minutes on the elliptical, the dynamic stretches we learned last week, and then jumped into a circuit program. My first stop was a plank, which I’m guessing was 60-90 seconds. From there it was a cable cross, working both sides of the core. The last, and my least favorite, stop was a two foot block, 15 pound weight, and a lot of stepping up, knee lifting, and burn. </p>
<p>After three rounds and a very brief break, we all kicked off the second circuit with two and half minutes of rotating between planks and side planks. My first stop was a balance/squat/core-cross-over-with-a-medicine-ball exercise. I then moved on to the TRX suspension training row, which involved pulling myself up with two feet on the ground from handles hanging from the ceiling, and quite a bit of soreness in my shoulders. And finally, dead lifts with a twenty pound medicine ball. Two rounds later, I was certainly tired, sweaty, and thankful that I was just another minute plank and handful of stretches away from being finished. </p>
<p>I walked down Boylston Street feeling energized, and woke up without too many sore muscles. But, since Marathon Strong&#8217;s a progressive training program, I might start fearing my Thursday evenings a tiny bit more.  </p>
