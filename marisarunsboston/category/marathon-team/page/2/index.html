<p>Sue, Paula, and I started this week’s Marathon Strong training session off by filling out our 2013 B.A.A. Boston Marathon registration forms, an exciting and surreal process. Since the entries are a pretty valuable commodity to come by, Lauren had given us specific instructions earlier in the week to fill the forms out perfectly. Thankfully we all completed them without any snafus, and we’re now officially committed to fundraising and running 26.2 miles for Healthworks Community Fitness! </p>
<p>During the training session Jason taught us a number of running drills to help us make our form and stride more efficient during the many miles ahead. After warming up with a few laps of lunges and karaokes, the first important step was setting our posture with knees slightly bent, hips forward, and hands above the head. The drills we learned were: hopping in place, to practice landing on the balls of our feet;  figure 4, pulling the foot up like it’s running along a rail on the other leg; and figure 4 at a pace of 180-190 beats per minute, landing as softly as possible. </p>
<p>After practicing them in place for a few minutes, we learned how easy moving forward actually feels thanks to gravity and a slight lean from the ankles. After two 5 minute circuits of combinations of lunges with a kettlebell, side planks, hopping in place, figure 4s, and karaokes, my heart rate was up and hamstrings were burning, all with good reason of course. Part of the lesson was also about getting us to reach a plateau and then recover&#8211;similar to how we’ll be feeling on and after Heartbreak Hill. </p>
<p>I was amazed during my five mile run the next evening when I could already feel how different my stride felt when I focused on the techniques we learned. My long run this weekend was just seven miles, which is recovery after nearly 10 last Sunday, with that and more drill practice I’ll be refreshed and ready for 12 next Saturday.</p>

<p>My marathon teammate Mike recently wrote a great reflective piece about his time spent coaching the running clinic and touring both Healthworks Community Fitness locations. It&#8217;s clear that the clubs and members left a strong impression on him, read his thoughts on his day at HCF on  <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/one-day-in-dorcester/">Hyland&#8217;s Be Here, Do That blog</a>. </p>

			<p>Led by Back Bay personal trainer and HCF volunteer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a>, the HCF team is participating in Marathon Strong, a running-specific progressive group training program that focuses on injury prevention, increasing performance, and improving running form. </p>
<p>I used to be a regular “straight up strength” class attendee, but it’s likely been 6 months or so since I’ve attended one of Healthworks many challenging group fitness <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/group-fitness/">classes</a>. So after (what I now realize) was a fairly introductory small group training session last Thursday, week two was quite the challenge.  </p>
<p>We started with five minutes on the elliptical, the dynamic stretches we learned last week, and then jumped into a circuit program. My first stop was a plank, which I’m guessing was 60-90 seconds. From there it was a cable cross, working both sides of the core. The last, and my least favorite, stop was a two foot block, 15 pound weight, and a lot of stepping up, knee lifting, and burn. </p>
<p>After three rounds and a very brief break, we all kicked off the second circuit with two and half minutes of rotating between planks and side planks. My first stop was a balance/squat/core-cross-over-with-a-medicine-ball exercise. I then moved on to the TRX suspension training row, which involved pulling myself up with two feet on the ground from handles hanging from the ceiling, and quite a bit of soreness in my shoulders. And finally, dead lifts with a twenty pound medicine ball. Two rounds later, I was certainly tired, sweaty, and thankful that I was just another minute plank and handful of stretches away from being finished. </p>
<p>I walked down Boylston Street feeling energized, and woke up without too many sore muscles. But, since Marathon Strong&#8217;s a progressive training program, I might start fearing my Thursday evenings a tiny bit more.  </p>

<p>Just before the new year I attended an informative fitness discussion and running clinic taught by Hyland’s Master Athletes <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/mike/">Mike</a> and <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/michelle/">Michelle</a> at Healthworks Community Fitness in Codman Square. </p>
<p>After sharing their own fitness histories and how they came to running multiple triathlons and marathons they asked to group to list off any and all questions about exercise. Curiosities included nutrition, how to start, how to get back to previous fitness levels, sleep, chemistry, and how to balance life with all of that exercising. </p>
<p>Mike and Michelle really sought to spark a personal connection to exercise within the attendees. They emphasized taking small steps, as well as accepting and acknowledging the accomplishments you make along the way. What stuck out for me was that, ultimately, very person’s body is different and so are the habits that make each of us feel like better runners and walkers. </p>
<p>We split into novice and experienced runner groups after the group discussion. Michelle covered and practiced the basic principles of running&#8211;form, stride, and breathing. Mike held an open Q&#038;A with the rest of the group, allowing us each to get specific and more personal questions answered. </p>
<p><a href="../../../../2013/01/hcf-running-clinic/photo-3-clinic/index.html" rel="attachment wp-att-107"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2013/01/photo-3-clinic.jpg" alt="photo 3 clinic" width="470" height="288" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107" /></a></p>

<p>Mike and Michelle ended the evening by reminding everyone to believe in themselves and their goals. It was obvious that they were impressed by HCF and the support it provides its members, and emphasized that having that space and network was key to successful training. </p>
<p>We were left with a 5K training plan, the goal being for members to run the Boston Athletic Association’s 5K the day before the marathon. Mike and Michelle will soon begin coaching interactive training sessions all thanks to Hyland’s and their sponsorship of Mike’s marathon bib. </p>

			<div class="byline"><abbr class="published" title="Friday, January 4th, 2013, 3:39 pm">January 4, 2013</abbr> &middot; by <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" href="../../../../author/admin.1.html" title="Marisa">Marisa</a></span> &middot; in <span class="category"><a href="../../../healthworks-fitness-centers-for-women/index.html" rel="tag">Healthworks Fitness Centers for Women</a>, <a href="../../../marathon-team.1.html" rel="tag">Marathon team</a></span> </div>				
			<p>After a week of cross country and west coast travel, the flu has taken its toll on me. My time with family and friends in Portland, Seattle, and southern California was all well spent, it’s the nearly 20 hours on 4 airplanes that I could have done without. I landed in Boston on Sunday evening congested, chilled, and achy, and haven’t moved too far from my apartment since then. </p>
<p>In between a lot of sleeping, I started to get especially nervous thinking about how far behind I was falling in my training. The marathon was 15 weeks from Monday, and my training plan officially started 16 weeks out. Now that it’s January, April 15 feels really soon. But when walking a quarter mile to Harvard Square was exhausting, I knew I wouldn’t be getting much running in this week. </p>
<p>Just thinking about how much I haven’t run wasn’t doing me any favors, so I forced myself to reexamine my training plans. To my relief, I’m really not too far behind. Sure missing three 4-mile runs this week isn’t something I can do again, but as long as I stick to the schedule, starting with 7 miles tomorrow, I’ll be okay. Running is mostly mental, so I’m counting on my pre-16 week milage to help make up for what I’ve most recently missed. </p>
<p>I didn’t want to miss out on my first marathon team training session this week and mustered up the energy to get to Healthworks Back Bay last night. Luckily, Jason took it fairly easy on us in covering some fundamental strengthening exercises. After a few minute jog on the treadmill, we spent the rest of the hour learning and practicing key stretches that make up a dynamic warm up, as well as foundation exercises such as squats, planks, and hip hinges. </p>
<p>I had done most of these exercises before, but having each movement explained in terms of how it helps align posture, build core strength, and/or improve running form was new and really useful. We’re expected to practice and perfect each stretch and exercise before our next training session&#8211;the dynamic warm-up will be especially helpful before I go out for 7 miles tomorrow. </p>

<p>Two unbelievable athletes will be coming to HCF on December 20 to share their incredible physical feats and offer an interactive running and walking clinic to attendees.

			<p>Earlier this week I attended my first Healthworks Community Fitness marathon team meeting with fellow runners Sue and Paula, our trainer Jason Sibley-Liddle, and HCF executive director <a href="http://healthworkscommunityfitness.org/staff">Lauren Broadhurst</a>. Sue, Paula, and I are all first time marathoners and shared mutual excitement and nervousness for the training ahead. Fortunately, we’re in good hands. </p>
<p>Over the next five months we’ll be meeting weekly at <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com">Healthworks Fitness Centers for Women</a> (HCF’s corporate founder) for a specialized group fitness program with Jason, who is a certified personal trainer at HW Back Bay, triathlete, and HCF volunteer. I’ve never worked with a trainer before, so I’m particularly excited to get much needed feedback on form, strength training, nutrition, and more. Another team perk is a free Healthworks membership through April, which I hope to use more so for yoga classes than 15+ mile treadmill runs. </p>
<p>As HCF marathon team members, we’re also expected to help with community outreach. Lauren gave us a thorough and inspiring overview of the organization’s history, highlighting relationships with community health centers that prescribe HCF memberships to their patients, and services such as free childcare, wellness coaching, and subsidized membership rates that encourage women of all fitness and income levels to join and fully utilize HCF.</p>
<div id="attachment_29" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 615px"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HCF_timeline.png"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HCF_timeline.png" alt="" title="HCF_timeline" width="605" height="421" class="size-full wp-image-29" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Healthworks Community Fitness&#8217; timeline and evolution</p></div>
<p>She also told us about our other teammate from Idaho, Mike Erhedt, a <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/mike/">Hyland’s Masters Athlete</a> and seasoned marathon runner&#8211;he ran one a day for eleven weeks in 2010. </p>
<p>Later this month we’ll have the chance to meet him and fellow Masters Athlete <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/michelle/">Michelle</a> when they visit HCF at Codman to coach a running clinic. They’re starting a club for HCF members to train and complete the Boston Athletic Association’s 5K, which is the day before the Boston Marathon. This will be a big feat for many of the participants, and I’m looking forward to meeting them soon. </p>
