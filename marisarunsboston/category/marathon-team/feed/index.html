				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t have thought of a better way to get my final 2 training miles in than at the HCF 5K this morning. Despite the cold weather&#8211;the temperature didn&#8217;t get above 40 degrees&#8211;an eager crowd still made it to the Hatchshell to get a 3 mile run, walk, or walk/run in. Seeing and feeling the enthusiasm among HCF members along the course and at the finish line was a joy.</p>
<p>It was also yet another reminder why Iâ€™m so proud to be running on the Healthworks Community Fitness Team, in support of an organization that means so much to me and so much to the women and children it helps lead healthier lives.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m thrilled that I met my $5,000 fundraising goal this week! With 13 days to go, I&#8217;m eager to continue raising even more vital funds for Healthworks Community Fitness and reach the marathon team&#8217;s overall goal of $30,000. </p>
<p>Receiving a donation really is a huge boost of motivation and I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to everyone that&#8217;s taken the time to contribute and express their support. The dollars raised by the marathon team will be a very significant portion of the total donations that HCF receives this year, which is what makes being part of the <a href="http://www.johnhancock.com/bostonmarathon/bostonmarathon_nonprofit.html">John Hancock Non-Profit Marathon Program</a> such a big deal. </p>
<p>It also means that each donation has significant impact on HCF&#8217;s two Dorchester community fitness centers and numerous programs for the health and well-being of women and children in need. </p>
<p>As an advisory board member, I&#8217;m hopeful that this will be the first of many years in which HCF is granted numbers&#8211;I know I certainly couldn&#8217;t imagine a better organization to run and fundraise for!   </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_435" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 480px"><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/21.jpg"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/21.jpg" alt="On the bus to Hopkinton; our loyal fan club; 21 miles; 21 miles complete! and a post 21-mile fortune" width="470" height="588" class="size-full wp-image-435" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">On the bus to Hopkinton; our loyal fan club; 21 miles; 21 miles complete! and a particularly inspiring post 21-mile fortune</p></div>
<p>On Saturday, like hundreds of other runners, I was dropped off at the Boston Marathon starting line in Hopkinton and began my longest and most important run yet. After missing the 19 miler and weeks of knee and IT band pain, I was more than a little nervous about the very crucial 21 miles ahead. </p>
<p>Prior to boarding the busses to Hopkinton, Marathon Coalition coach Rick Muhr imparted some very useful <a href="http://bostonmarathoncoach.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/upcoming-boston-marathon-21-miler/">advice</a> on how to navigate the course&#8211;run the first 10K of mostly descending roads conservatively, find your rhythm between miles 10-15, take it easier on the Newton Hills from 16-21, and let your adrenaline + everything you&#8217;ve got left carry you to the finish line. Easy enough, right?</p>
<p>Pacing has been an issue for me all training season, starting every long run with miles a good 30 seconds faster than what I end with&#8211;a pattern that I really couldn&#8217;t afford to follow on my initial downhill miles if I wanted to make it to the last few uphill. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I was in excellent company from the starting line through Wellesley; running with my HCF teammate Sue not only kept my pace incredibly even, but made the time and miles fly by. From the beginning we agreed that neither of us were out to break any records, but that there were no hard feelings if she or I wanted to speed up, slow down, or put our headphones on. </p>
<p>At times, especially on the early descents when other runners were zipping by, I thought I wanted to speed up, but thanks to my even keeled running partner, I didn&#8217;t. And rather than thinking about how many miles I&#8217;d gone, or how many more were left, I enjoyed them.</p>
<p>Marathon Strong trainer Jason was at the 10K point in Framingham to cheer us on, and again four miles down the road in Natick along with HCF Executive Director Lauren, who jumped right in to run with us. A few quick miles later I was surprised to see that we were already making our way into Wellesley, the marathon&#8217;s halfway point, and a part of the course that Sue and I knew well by now.</p>
<p>Being able to recognize the course was both relieving, knowing that we were getting close, and intimidating, knowing the difficult stretches ahead. At mile 14, my legs were certainly feeling the effects of all those downhills and I knew it was time to slow down and say goodbye to Sue. Lauren kindly stayed with me just past the dreariest part of the course, mile 16, over Route 128, parting by reminding me just how little having 4+ miles left was when I had already made it so far. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say the rest of the way was a breeze or that I powered through every hill ahead&#8211;it wasn&#8217;t, and I walked up nearly every hill between miles 17-21. But, I can say that I felt pretty good, and, finally, ecstatic when I was met with cheers from 3 familiar faces at the day&#8217;s finish line, atop Heartbreak Hill.      </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After 11 Marathon Strong sessions, it&#8217;s clear that the program has been invaluable to the HCF team&#8217;s overall success in training for Boston. We&#8217;ve not only learned A LOT about form and stride, warming up, stretching, foam rolling, and injuries, but have also been incredibly supported by <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/clubs/back-bay/">Healthworks Back Bay</a> personal trainer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a>. </p>
<p>Most training sessions have started with a round of 20 questions, which Jason has handled with quite a bit of patience toward the three of us first time marathon runners, he&#8217;s also given up many of his Saturday mornings to run with us and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.416246778465139.1073741827.104933796263107&amp;type=1/">provide water stops</a>, and most recently, has even offered to drop us off at the Boston Marathon starting line, which is in Hopkinton&#8211;26 miles away. (This would save us from boarding buses to Hopkinton in the Boston Common at 7:00am and waiting there until our 10:40am start time.)</p>
<p>At less than 5 weeks until the big day(!), now is the time when many first time marathon runners pick up a few injuries, me and the HCF team included. What I&#8217;ve realized over these last couple of weeks of particularly irritating knee/IT band pain is that without my team and trainer I&#8217;d be pretty discouraged and lost. There&#8217;s so much information about running out there, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to decipher. </p>
<p>After reading a few articles about IT bands the other night, I&#8217;d had enough, and couldn&#8217;t imagine having to rely on any of them for an answer or hint as to what the actual problem might be. I also realized, after reading bits from the comments sections, that my pain would be a whole lot worse without Marathon Strong. It seemed like many of the commentators didn&#8217;t really know the first thing about form, core strength, and stretching&#8211;things that I wouldn&#8217;t have a clue about either.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we&#8217;ve been working on each of these aspects progressively&#8211;each lunge, hip flexor stretch, plank, squat, 30 seconds of running in place, foam roll, and circuit, painful as certain segments has been, has had a pretty meaningful purpose. I&#8217;ve become more attuned than ever to how and why my legs are feeling a certain a way&#8211;and when I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m surrounded by a wealth of knowledge on the HCF team.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Itâ€™s hard to believe that there are less than 7 weeks until the Boston Marathon. I&#8217;ve come a long way since I <a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/2012/11/im-running-the-2013-boston-marathon/">accepted</a> my spot on the Healthworks Community Fitness Marathon Team in November, but my stomach still does a flip when I think about how quickly April will arrive. </p>
<p>In December, I had more than a few sleepless nights thinking about <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/marisag/">fundraising</a> $5,000, and while I&#8217;m now sleeping much more soundly, it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m at ease with the amount of money I&#8217;ve raised (I&#8217;m not), but rather, because my body is just so tired. Day or night, much of my anxiety now comes from thinking about the actual marathon running. </p>
<p>Going from running 4 miles to 16 in just 11 weeks is a pretty good feeling, and thinking about that accomplishment keeps my hopes high for getting up to 26 miles over the next 6 weeks. As the long runs have increased, so have my feelings of bliss when I&#8217;ve completed them. But, that hasn&#8217;t come without a fair share of increasingly heavy legs, aches, and pains.</p>
<p>This week the HCF team ran 13 miles with Marathon Coalition, a recovery distance to get ready for the next push upward. I felt lighter all week knowing I&#8217;d only have to run a half marathon on Saturday morning, which is truly a thought I never saw coming and another reassuring indication of how I&#8217;ve far I&#8217;ve come.   </p>
<p>Before we headed out, MC <a href="http://bostonmarathoncoach.wordpress.com/about/">Coach Rick Muhr</a> reminded us of how little training time is left, just 2 more long runs (19 and 21 miles) before they taper, but that even when the distance decreases, every run counts until April 15. He said a lot of runners take the shorter runs too lightly, thinking <em>only</em> 13 miles and running them too quickly, which, after months of training, creates the perfect conditions for injury.</p>
<p>To my extreme surprise (and after adamantly thinking that&#8217;s not me during Rick&#8217;s talk), I fell right into that trap today and averaged a pace a good 20-25 seconds faster than any other of my long runs. I&#8217;m crediting that to the fact that it was the warmest (40 degrees), sunniest, and all around most pleasant Saturday morning I&#8217;ve run on, but, I&#8217;ve learned my lesson. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/half-marathon.jpg"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/half-marathon.jpg" alt="half marathon" width="470" height="313" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340" /></a></p>
<p>After 13.25 miles of the same Wellesley Hills we ran last week, I was far more red-faced, achy, and tired than I&#8217;ve been in weeks prior&#8211;a feeling I haven&#8217;t quite kicked all day. The bliss of being done has been subdued by a bothersome left knee and quick realization that 19 miles is less than a week away. Thankfully, I have a foam roller, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GLrKr54yA0/">advice</a> from <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a>, and ample reason to get some serious mental and physical rest before next Saturday. </p>

HCF ED <a href="http://healthworkscommunityfitness.org/staff">Lauren Broadhurst</a> and Marathon Strong trainer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a> kindly attended this Saturdayâ€™s 8am Marathon Coalition training to run with and cheer on me and <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/paulasandler">Paula</a>. (<a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a> took the weekend off to give her achy knee a break.) The MC had an 18 mile route mapped out, which was, thankfully, very straightforward since the four of us were all planning on going different lengths.</p>
<p>Paula, fresh off the plane from a business trip in Japan, was running 13; Jason, a day before running the Hyannis Half Marathon was going out for 8; Lauren, who hadnâ€™t run in a few months, didnâ€™t have an exact number in mind; and I was running 16, the furthest Iâ€™ve ever gone.</p>
<p>Since Iâ€™ve been starting my long runs with miles nearly 2 minutes faster than Iâ€™ve been ending them with, I felt like I really needed to work on pacing. Lauren, who once ran 4 marathons in 9 months, agreed and urged me to get into the habit of starting off much more slowly. Lucky for me, she also volunteered to pace me.</p>
<p>We started just near the base of Heartbreak Hill, reversing the course and running west, away from Boston. Lauren ran with me for the first 6 miles, keeping me right on pace at hour 1, and, more importantly, concentrated on conversation rather than time and distance.</p>
<p>After running so many miles solo, talking while running was a bit challenging, but also tremendously helpful. She said my marathon pace shouldnâ€™t be faster than what I can hold a conversation at, and though Iâ€™m not convinced I couldâ€™ve held one from miles 10-16, I am sure that the first 6 miles of talking really helped me get through the last 6. Itâ€™s amazing how a little distraction for an hour can keep you going for another hour and forty.</p>
<p>Between yesterday and last weekend, Iâ€™ve now run nearly 10 miles of the course. 3 have been in reverse, but the other 7 have been eye opening. From what Iâ€™ve seen and felt so far, Heartbreak Hill is not the only heartbreaker on the course.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/seac-shoes.jpg"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/seac-shoes.jpg" alt="seac shoes" width="470" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-298" /></a><br />
After I felt barefoot during a 10 mile run a few weeks ago, I realized it was finally time for a new pair of shoes. Although I couldnâ€™t remember when I last bought running shoes, I hadnâ€™t been too concerned about my feet  considering how minimal my running was prior to marathon training and the mixed <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/when-to-retire-a-running-shoe/">arguments</a> around how long you should wear them. </p>
<p>Although Iâ€™m usually pretty particular about shopping, buying fitness gear has never been much of a priority. But, after Jason recommended the <a href="http://www.southendathleticcompany.com">South End Athletic Company&#8217;s</a> gait analysis to the HCF team, and <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a> returned to the next Marathon Strong session with rave reviews and a healed injury, I was actually excited to pick out running shoes.</p>
<p>They really do make buying running shoes easy and informative. I stopped by the store on a weekday afternoon and was quickly handed a minimalist pair of shoes and instructed to hop on the treadmill. An employ video recorded my stride for one minute of running and then reviewed it with me. I live near another running store and see a lot of people awkwardly running down the block while a sales associate watches, something Iâ€™ve also done before. My sock choice might have been a bit embarrassing for the video, but running inside the store on a tucked away treadmill and then seeing my gait frame by frame was a much more comfortable and enlightening experience. I could actually see why I should buy a particular shoe. </p>
<p>Like a lot of people, I tend to overpronate, which means that I need a bit of help my to keep my feet stable. SEACâ€™s shoes are grouped by the amount of support they provide, so I was a bit disappointed to see that the coolest looking shoes ones tend to have the least amount of cushioning (on the left), and that Iâ€™d be stuck with another clunky pair of sneakers (to the right). </p>
<p>I tried on a good 4-6 pairs of shoes, in varying brands, sizes, and levels of support. What I liked was that I didn&#8217;t have to make many decisions, and was simply given the best pairs for my gait, which were also all around the same price point. And though I really wanted to go with the slimmer cooler looking choice, I knew I had to go with the more supportive, size bigger, bulky shoe. Thankfully, not many of SEAC&#8217;s choices are white, and I still walked out with the best looking and fitting pair of running shoes (Asics GT2000) Iâ€™ve ever bought.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Saturday I finally made it to my first <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MarathonCoalition?fref=ts">Marathon Coalition</a> run. The Boston Marathon Coalition is a group of 13 BAA and John Hancock sponsored youth focused charities that train together and support each otherâ€™s outreach efforts throughout the marathon season. <a href="http://bostonmarathoncoach.wordpress.com/about/">Coach Rick Muhr</a> graciously allowed the HCF team to practice with the Coalition this year, which is a rare exception that weâ€™re grateful he made for our small group. </p>
<p>Sue and Paula kindly picked me up at 7:40am on Saturday to meet nearly 100 other runners in the basement of the First Baptist Church in Newton. We arrived to a nearly packed room of people stretching, hydrating, and chatting, and around 8:20, Rick took the floor to motivate the crowd. He reminded us that as of Friday there were just 2 months until the big day, and that nowâ€™s the time to stay focused and remain positive about just what an exciting opportunity running Boston is. We then heard about Camp Shriver, the non profit hosting the dayâ€™s water stops (they rotate each week), the 17 mile route and we were off. </p>
<p>I got off to a bit of a later start than the rest of the group and, despite having a map and the MC&#8217;s Map My Run route on my phone, I was pretty disoriented leaving and returning to the church. Once I found my way I followed most of the Coalitionâ€™s route, but since they were putting in a few more miles than I was, I decided to skip out on the Boston/Beacon Street portion of the run. This allowed me to see some new scenery and do most of my run on the Newton/Commonwealth Ave section of the actual <a href="http://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon.aspx">marathon course</a>.</p>
<p>I didnâ€™t realize at the time that I actually ran down Heartbreak Hill, but only about a quarter mile back up. Going down wasnâ€™t so bad, but I certainly wasnâ€™t envious of other runners on their way up. My short ascent was only in an effort to get in the last 2.2 miles I needed to get to 15&#8211;I had miscalculated how far out Comm. Ave. I needed to go before heading back to the Church. </p>
<p>Up until this weekend, Iâ€™d been doing my long runs alone and in the late afternoon. While I still ran solo, it was nice to have a motivating group to start the day off with as well as to be done, and feel a bit freer, by 1pm on Saturday than I have during previous weekends. Just four and a half days and counting until 16 miles. </p>
