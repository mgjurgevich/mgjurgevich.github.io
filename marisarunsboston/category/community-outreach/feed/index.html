				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t have thought of a better way to get my final 2 training miles in than at the HCF 5K this morning. Despite the cold weather&#8211;the temperature didn&#8217;t get above 40 degrees&#8211;an eager crowd still made it to the Hatchshell to get a 3 mile run, walk, or walk/run in. Seeing and feeling the enthusiasm among HCF members along the course and at the finish line was a joy.</p>
<p>It was also yet another reminder why I’m so proud to be running on the Healthworks Community Fitness Team, in support of an organization that means so much to me and so much to the women and children it helps lead healthier lives.</p>

<p>Enjoy a short video of the December running clinic at HCF, filmed and sponsored by  <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/">Hyland&#8217;s Active</a>! </p>
<p>As of Monday, over 40 runners had signed up the HCF 5K Running Club in preparation for the Esplanade HCF 5K on Saturday, April 13th. Although I won&#8217;t be running that day, I&#8217;m excited to cheer on members and pick up some last minute inspiration before Patriot&#8217;s Day. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/2013/01/hcf-running-clinic/photo-2-clinic/" rel="attachment wp-att-106"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/photo-2-clinic.jpg" alt="photo 2 clinic" width="470" height="303" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-106" /></a></p>
<p>Just before the new year I attended an informative fitness discussion and running clinic taught by Hyland’s Master Athletes <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/mike/">Mike</a> and <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/michelle/">Michelle</a> at Healthworks Community Fitness in Codman Square. </p>
<p>After sharing their own fitness histories and how they came to running multiple triathlons and marathons they asked to group to list off any and all questions about exercise. Curiosities included nutrition, how to start, how to get back to previous fitness levels, sleep, chemistry, and how to balance life with all of that exercising. </p>
<p>Mike and Michelle really sought to spark a personal connection to exercise within the attendees. They emphasized taking small steps, as well as accepting and acknowledging the accomplishments you make along the way. What stuck out for me was that, ultimately, very person’s body is different and so are the habits that make each of us feel like better runners and walkers. </p>
<p>We split into novice and experienced runner groups after the group discussion. Michelle covered and practiced the basic principles of running&#8211;form, stride, and breathing. Mike held an open Q&#038;A with the rest of the group, allowing us each to get specific and more personal questions answered. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/2013/01/hcf-running-clinic/photo-3-clinic/" rel="attachment wp-att-107"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/photo-3-clinic.jpg" alt="photo 3 clinic" width="470" height="288" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-107" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/2013/01/hcf-running-clinic/photo-4-clinic/" rel="attachment wp-att-108"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/photo-4-clinic.jpg" alt="photo 4 clinic" width="470" height="358" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-108" /></a></p>
<p>Mike and Michelle ended the evening by reminding everyone to believe in themselves and their goals. It was obvious that they were impressed by HCF and the support it provides its members, and emphasized that having that space and network was key to successful training. </p>
<p>We were left with a 5K training plan, the goal being for members to run the Boston Athletic Association’s 5K the day before the marathon. Mike and Michelle will soon begin coaching interactive training sessions all thanks to Hyland’s and their sponsorship of Mike’s marathon bib. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week I attended my first Healthworks Community Fitness marathon team meeting with fellow runners Sue and Paula, our trainer Jason Sibley-Liddle, and HCF executive director <a href="http://healthworkscommunityfitness.org/staff">Lauren Broadhurst</a>. Sue, Paula, and I are all first time marathoners and shared mutual excitement and nervousness for the training ahead. Fortunately, we’re in good hands. </p>
<p>Over the next five months we’ll be meeting weekly at <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com">Healthworks Fitness Centers for Women</a> (HCF’s corporate founder) for a specialized group fitness program with Jason, who is a certified personal trainer at HW Back Bay, triathlete, and HCF volunteer. I’ve never worked with a trainer before, so I’m particularly excited to get much needed feedback on form, strength training, nutrition, and more. Another team perk is a free Healthworks membership through April, which I hope to use more so for yoga classes than 15+ mile treadmill runs. </p>
<p>As HCF marathon team members, we’re also expected to help with community outreach. Lauren gave us a thorough and inspiring overview of the organization’s history, highlighting relationships with community health centers that prescribe HCF memberships to their patients, and services such as free childcare, wellness coaching, and subsidized membership rates that encourage women of all fitness and income levels to join and fully utilize HCF.</p>
<div id="attachment_29" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 615px"><a href="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HCF_timeline.png"><img src="http://www.marisarunsboston.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/HCF_timeline.png" alt="" title="HCF_timeline" width="605" height="421" class="size-full wp-image-29" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Healthworks Community Fitness&#8217; timeline and evolution</p></div>
<p>She also told us about our other teammate from Idaho, Mike Erhedt, a <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/mike/">Hyland’s Masters Athlete</a> and seasoned marathon runner&#8211;he ran one a day for eleven weeks in 2010. </p>
<p>Later this month we’ll have the chance to meet him and fellow Masters Athlete <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/michelle/">Michelle</a> when they visit HCF at Codman to coach a running clinic. They’re starting a club for HCF members to train and complete the Boston Athletic Association’s 5K, which is the day before the Boston Marathon. This will be a big feat for many of the participants, and I’m looking forward to meeting them soon. </p>
