				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After experiencing the joy of completing a 21 mile run two weeks ago, subsequent miles have been slightly underwhelming, and, physically and mentally, training has been a bit of a roller coaster. Throughout the entire training season, I&#8217;ve heard that once you reach 20 miles, you can go 26.</p>
<p>When I reached the top of Heartbreak Hill from Hopkinton just over two weeks ago, I was beyond thrilled, as well as relieved, confident that in another 3 weeks I&#8217;d be ready to complete the next 5 miles. Yet, as the memory of that day fades further away and the reality of the marathon comes closer, it&#8217;s been hard to keep creeping feelings of doubt and uncertainty at bay.</p>
<p>It was no surprise that just about every inch of my legs were sore or that I felt all around fatigued for a few days after 21. But my mind started to wander when I was winded after running a couple miles one day, my achilles suddenly swelled in pain shortly after that, and a severe head cold left me completely exhausted, and from running, for days.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve been trying not to speculate, it&#8217;s difficult not to rehash the training miles I&#8217;ve missed, the lousy 8 miles I ran on Saturday, or just how heavy my legs felt in Newton a few weeks ago and what that&#8217;ll all mean on Monday. At this point, it&#8217;s easy to get caught up in every single detail of the past 15 weeks and the next 7 days, but it&#8217;s not wise.</p>
<p>So what I keep reminding myself instead is that the gas is in the tank; I&#8217;ve logged the time and miles, what&#8217;s done is done. The only certainties are that there&#8217;s a marathon on Monday and that I&#8217;ll be at the starting line at 10:40. And the unknowns, when or how I get to the finish line, won&#8217;t happen or go well unless I believe I can make it there.</p>
