<p>On Saturday, like hundreds of other runners, I was dropped off at the Boston Marathon starting line in Hopkinton and began my longest and most important run yet. After missing the 19 miler and weeks of knee and IT band pain, I was more than a little nervous about the very crucial 21 miles ahead. </p>
<p>Prior to boarding the busses to Hopkinton, Marathon Coalition coach Rick Muhr imparted some very useful <a href="http://bostonmarathoncoach.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/upcoming-boston-marathon-21-miler/">advice</a> on how to navigate the course&#8211;run the first 10K of mostly descending roads conservatively, find your rhythm between miles 10-15, take it easier on the Newton Hills from 16-21, and let your adrenaline + everything you&#8217;ve got left carry you to the finish line. Easy enough, right?</p>
<p>Pacing has been an issue for me all training season, starting every long run with miles a good 30 seconds faster than what I end with&#8211;a pattern that I really couldn&#8217;t afford to follow on my initial downhill miles if I wanted to make it to the last few uphill. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I was in excellent company from the starting line through Wellesley; running with my HCF teammate Sue not only kept my pace incredibly even, but made the time and miles fly by. From the beginning we agreed that neither of us were out to break any records, but that there were no hard feelings if she or I wanted to speed up, slow down, or put our headphones on. </p>
<p>At times, especially on the early descents when other runners were zipping by, I thought I wanted to speed up, but thanks to my even keeled running partner, I didn&#8217;t. And rather than thinking about how many miles I&#8217;d gone, or how many more were left, I enjoyed them.</p>
<p>Marathon Strong trainer Jason was at the 10K point in Framingham to cheer us on, and again four miles down the road in Natick along with HCF Executive Director Lauren, who jumped right in to run with us. A few quick miles later I was surprised to see that we were already making our way into Wellesley, the marathon&#8217;s halfway point, and a part of the course that Sue and I knew well by now.</p>
<p>Being able to recognize the course was both relieving, knowing that we were getting close, and intimidating, knowing the difficult stretches ahead. At mile 14, my legs were certainly feeling the effects of all those downhills and I knew it was time to slow down and say goodbye to Sue. Lauren kindly stayed with me just past the dreariest part of the course, mile 16, over Route 128, parting by reminding me just how little having 4+ miles left was when I had already made it so far. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say the rest of the way was a breeze or that I powered through every hill ahead&#8211;it wasn&#8217;t, and I walked up nearly every hill between miles 17-21. But, I can say that I felt pretty good, and, finally, ecstatic when I was met with cheers from 3 familiar faces at the day&#8217;s finish line, atop Heartbreak Hill.      </p>

			<p>Itâ€™s hard to believe that there are less than 7 weeks until the Boston Marathon. I&#8217;ve come a long way since I <a href="../../index.html%3Fp=1.html">accepted</a> my spot on the Healthworks Community Fitness Marathon Team in November, but my stomach still does a flip when I think about how quickly April will arrive. </p>
<p>In December, I had more than a few sleepless nights thinking about <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/marisag/">fundraising</a> $5,000, and while I&#8217;m now sleeping much more soundly, it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m at ease with the amount of money I&#8217;ve raised (I&#8217;m not), but rather, because my body is just so tired. Day or night, much of my anxiety now comes from thinking about the actual marathon running. </p>
<p>Going from running 4 miles to 16 in just 11 weeks is a pretty good feeling, and thinking about that accomplishment keeps my hopes high for getting up to 26 miles over the next 6 weeks. As the long runs have increased, so have my feelings of bliss when I&#8217;ve completed them. But, that hasn&#8217;t come without a fair share of increasingly heavy legs, aches, and pains.</p>
<p>This week the HCF team ran 13 miles with Marathon Coalition, a recovery distance to get ready for the next push upward. I felt lighter all week knowing I&#8217;d only have to run a half marathon on Saturday morning, which is truly a thought I never saw coming and another reassuring indication of how I&#8217;ve far I&#8217;ve come.   </p>
<p>Before we headed out, MC <a href="http://bostonmarathoncoach.wordpress.com/about/">Coach Rick Muhr</a> reminded us of how little training time is left, just 2 more long runs (19 and 21 miles) before they taper, but that even when the distance decreases, every run counts until April 15. He said a lot of runners take the shorter runs too lightly, thinking <em>only</em> 13 miles and running them too quickly, which, after months of training, creates the perfect conditions for injury.</p>
<p>To my extreme surprise (and after adamantly thinking that&#8217;s not me during Rick&#8217;s talk), I fell right into that trap today and averaged a pace a good 20-25 seconds faster than any other of my long runs. I&#8217;m crediting that to the fact that it was the warmest (40 degrees), sunniest, and all around most pleasant Saturday morning I&#8217;ve run on, but, I&#8217;ve learned my lesson. </p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/half-marathon.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/half-marathon.jpg" alt="half marathon" width="470" height="313" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340" /></a></p>
<p>After 13.25 miles of the same Wellesley Hills we ran last week, I was far more red-faced, achy, and tired than I&#8217;ve been in weeks prior&#8211;a feeling I haven&#8217;t quite kicked all day. The bliss of being done has been subdued by a bothersome left knee and quick realization that 19 miles is less than a week away. Thankfully, I have a foam roller, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GLrKr54yA0/">advice</a> from <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a>, and ample reason to get some serious mental and physical rest before next Saturday. </p>

HCF ED <a href="http://healthworkscommunityfitness.org/staff">Lauren Broadhurst</a> and Marathon Strong trainer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a> kindly attended this Saturdayâ€™s 8am Marathon Coalition training to run with and cheer on me and <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/paulasandler">Paula</a>. (<a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a> took the weekend off to give her achy knee a break.) The MC had an 18 mile route mapped out, which was, thankfully, very straightforward since the four of us were all planning on going different lengths.</p>
<p>Paula, fresh off the plane from a business trip in Japan, was running 13; Jason, a day before running the Hyannis Half Marathon was going out for 8; Lauren, who hadnâ€™t run in a few months, didnâ€™t have an exact number in mind; and I was running 16, the furthest Iâ€™ve ever gone.</p>
<p>Since Iâ€™ve been starting my long runs with miles nearly 2 minutes faster than Iâ€™ve been ending them with, I felt like I really needed to work on pacing. Lauren, who once ran 4 marathons in 9 months, agreed and urged me to get into the habit of starting off much more slowly. Lucky for me, she also volunteered to pace me.</p>
<p>We started just near the base of Heartbreak Hill, reversing the course and running west, away from Boston. Lauren ran with me for the first 6 miles, keeping me right on pace at hour 1, and, more importantly, concentrated on conversation rather than time and distance.</p>
<p>After running so many miles solo, talking while running was a bit challenging, but also tremendously helpful. She said my marathon pace shouldnâ€™t be faster than what I can hold a conversation at, and though Iâ€™m not convinced I couldâ€™ve held one from miles 10-16, I am sure that the first 6 miles of talking really helped me get through the last 6. Itâ€™s amazing how a little distraction for an hour can keep you going for another hour and forty.</p>
<p>Between yesterday and last weekend, Iâ€™ve now run nearly 10 miles of the course. 3 have been in reverse, but the other 7 have been eye opening. From what Iâ€™ve seen and felt so far, Heartbreak Hill is not the only heartbreaker on the course.</p>

			<p>This Saturday I finally made it to my first <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MarathonCoalition?fref=ts">Marathon Coalition</a> run. The Boston Marathon Coalition is a group of 13 BAA and John Hancock sponsored youth focused charities that train together and support each otherâ€™s outreach efforts throughout the marathon season. <a href="http://bostonmarathoncoach.wordpress.com/about/">Coach Rick Muhr</a> graciously allowed the HCF team to practice with the Coalition this year, which is a rare exception that weâ€™re grateful he made for our small group. </p>
<p>Sue and Paula kindly picked me up at 7:40am on Saturday to meet nearly 100 other runners in the basement of the First Baptist Church in Newton. We arrived to a nearly packed room of people stretching, hydrating, and chatting, and around 8:20, Rick took the floor to motivate the crowd. He reminded us that as of Friday there were just 2 months until the big day, and that nowâ€™s the time to stay focused and remain positive about just what an exciting opportunity running Boston is. We then heard about Camp Shriver, the non profit hosting the dayâ€™s water stops (they rotate each week), the 17 mile route and we were off. </p>
<p>I got off to a bit of a later start than the rest of the group and, despite having a map and the MC&#8217;s Map My Run route on my phone, I was pretty disoriented leaving and returning to the church. Once I found my way I followed most of the Coalitionâ€™s route, but since they were putting in a few more miles than I was, I decided to skip out on the Boston/Beacon Street portion of the run. This allowed me to see some new scenery and do most of my run on the Newton/Commonwealth Ave section of the actual <a href="http://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon.aspx">marathon course</a>.</p>
<p>I didnâ€™t realize at the time that I actually ran down Heartbreak Hill, but only about a quarter mile back up. Going down wasnâ€™t so bad, but I certainly wasnâ€™t envious of other runners on their way up. My short ascent was only in an effort to get in the last 2.2 miles I needed to get to 15&#8211;I had miscalculated how far out Comm. Ave. I needed to go before heading back to the Church. </p>
<p>Up until this weekend, Iâ€™d been doing my long runs alone and in the late afternoon. While I still ran solo, it was nice to have a motivating group to start the day off with as well as to be done, and feel a bit freer, by 1pm on Saturday than I have during previous weekends. Just four and a half days and counting until 16 miles. </p>
