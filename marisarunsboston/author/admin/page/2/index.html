After I felt barefoot during a 10 mile run a few weeks ago, I realized it was finally time for a new pair of shoes. Although I couldn’t remember when I last bought running shoes, I hadn’t been too concerned about my feet  considering how minimal my running was prior to marathon training and the mixed <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/when-to-retire-a-running-shoe/">arguments</a> around how long you should wear them. </p>
<p>Although I’m usually pretty particular about shopping, buying fitness gear has never been much of a priority. But, after Jason recommended the <a href="http://www.southendathleticcompany.com">South End Athletic Company&#8217;s</a> gait analysis to the HCF team, and <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a> returned to the next Marathon Strong session with rave reviews and a healed injury, I was actually excited to pick out running shoes.</p>
<p>They really do make buying running shoes easy and informative. I stopped by the store on a weekday afternoon and was quickly handed a minimalist pair of shoes and instructed to hop on the treadmill. An employ video recorded my stride for one minute of running and then reviewed it with me. I live near another running store and see a lot of people awkwardly running down the block while a sales associate watches, something I’ve also done before. My sock choice might have been a bit embarrassing for the video, but running inside the store on a tucked away treadmill and then seeing my gait frame by frame was a much more comfortable and enlightening experience. I could actually see why I should buy a particular shoe. </p>
<p>Like a lot of people, I tend to overpronate, which means that I need a bit of help my to keep my feet stable. SEAC’s shoes are grouped by the amount of support they provide, so I was a bit disappointed to see that the coolest looking shoes ones tend to have the least amount of cushioning (on the left), and that I’d be stuck with another clunky pair of sneakers (to the right). </p>
<p>I tried on a good 4-6 pairs of shoes, in varying brands, sizes, and levels of support. What I liked was that I didn&#8217;t have to make many decisions, and was simply given the best pairs for my gait, which were also all around the same price point. And though I really wanted to go with the slimmer cooler looking choice, I knew I had to go with the more supportive, size bigger, bulky shoe. Thankfully, not many of SEAC&#8217;s choices are white, and I still walked out with the best looking and fitting pair of running shoes (Asics GT2000) I’ve ever bought.</p>

			<p>This Saturday I finally made it to my first <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MarathonCoalition?fref=ts">Marathon Coalition</a> run. The Boston Marathon Coalition is a group of 13 BAA and John Hancock sponsored youth focused charities that train together and support each other’s outreach efforts throughout the marathon season. <a href="http://bostonmarathoncoach.wordpress.com/about/">Coach Rick Muhr</a> graciously allowed the HCF team to practice with the Coalition this year, which is a rare exception that we’re grateful he made for our small group. </p>
<p>Sue and Paula kindly picked me up at 7:40am on Saturday to meet nearly 100 other runners in the basement of the First Baptist Church in Newton. We arrived to a nearly packed room of people stretching, hydrating, and chatting, and around 8:20, Rick took the floor to motivate the crowd. He reminded us that as of Friday there were just 2 months until the big day, and that now’s the time to stay focused and remain positive about just what an exciting opportunity running Boston is. We then heard about Camp Shriver, the non profit hosting the day’s water stops (they rotate each week), the 17 mile route and we were off. </p>
<p>I got off to a bit of a later start than the rest of the group and, despite having a map and the MC&#8217;s Map My Run route on my phone, I was pretty disoriented leaving and returning to the church. Once I found my way I followed most of the Coalition’s route, but since they were putting in a few more miles than I was, I decided to skip out on the Boston/Beacon Street portion of the run. This allowed me to see some new scenery and do most of my run on the Newton/Commonwealth Ave section of the actual <a href="http://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon.aspx">marathon course</a>.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize at the time that I actually ran down Heartbreak Hill, but only about a quarter mile back up. Going down wasn’t so bad, but I certainly wasn’t envious of other runners on their way up. My short ascent was only in an effort to get in the last 2.2 miles I needed to get to 15&#8211;I had miscalculated how far out Comm. Ave. I needed to go before heading back to the Church. </p>
<p>Up until this weekend, I’d been doing my long runs alone and in the late afternoon. While I still ran solo, it was nice to have a motivating group to start the day off with as well as to be done, and feel a bit freer, by 1pm on Saturday than I have during previous weekends. Just four and a half days and counting until 16 miles. </p>

<p>Over the last six weeks, I’ve been running between 3 and 7 miles Tuesday through Thursday. Running home from work has been a wonderful way to get that mileage in. I get home faster than my regular bus to train commute, avoid traffic and other irritations of public transportation, and, overall, just feel better once I reach my front door. </p>
<p>Boston is a small city that often takes a frustratingly long time to navigate. I don’t own a car, but over four years here my desire for one has decreased, parallel parking and shoveling 25+ inches of snow are just a couple of reasons for that. But mainly, I don’t need one. </p>
<p>The last eight months, however, have really tested my love for the MBTA. Commuting to my newish office, less than 4 miles from my home, takes between 40 and 60 minutes each way, sometimes longer, very rarely shorter. Spending that much time on or waiting for buses or trains twice a day started to wear on me pretty quickly. </p>
<p>I’d walked home from work a few times over the summer, but it was usually a last minute decision, usually when I realized there was a Red Sox game and knew I’d be better off on foot, and it wasn’t really a welcomed alternative or appreciated the same way that running has been. That’s mainly because walking didn’t actually get me home any faster, but partially because I didn’t feel like I had to do it. </p>
<p>Exercising 5 days a week has been a big adjustment and challenge, and I’m actually not sure if it’s something I had ever done before I began training. But after 6 weeks of running home 2 or 3 evenings a week, I’m hooked, as well as convinced that it’s the best way to exercise (and commute) now and beyond April 15.</p>
<p>Cambridge (home) and Boston (work) are divided by the Charles River, and the surrounding bike path and handful of pedestrian friendly bridges are ideal for covering the majority of the 3.5 miles between. Even on the coldest or most tiring days, I know I’ll warm up faster and feel better than I would waiting for and on the bus. And although it’s not really getting any warmer, it’s staying lighter later, at the perfect time, just as I begin more 8-10 mile midweek runs. But, I do have a <a href="http://www.rei.com/product/843412/nathan-headgasket-headband-with-leds/">earwarmer-headlamp</a> for darker evenings, bikers being a bigger worry than cars. </p>
<p>Sadly, the biggest barrier to running home just arrived over the weekend&#8211;5 foot snow banks don’t create very welcoming sidewalks or bike paths, but I’m crossing my fingers for enough melting and plowing today to help that problem. I’d certainly rather run through puddles than face another nearly 3 hours of trains tomorrow. </p>

<p>As of  Sunday, 12 miles is the furthest I’ve ever run. Before I headed out I was thinking back to the last time I ran <em>nearly</em> 12 miles. To my surprise, I realized it had been over 7 years since that October day in Washington, D.C. when my sister and I ran the “Army 10-miler.” I found myself back in the same routine that we started our race day with&#8211;chugging water, eating toast, and asking myself: am I ready for this? Similar to that morning, I felt mixed. </p>
<p>Shortly after I accepted my position on the HCF team, a friend asked when I thought training would start to get <em>really</em> hard. My response:  anything over 11.25, because that was unknown territory. </p>
<p>The year my sister and I ran the 10-miler, the course was actually rerouted mid-race because of a bomb scare on the 14th Street Bridge, something I didn’t learn until I crossed the finish line. I was frustrated and tired at the end, as well as upset that I would never receive an official time, albeit that was mainly due to a little sibling rivalry and never having proof of running faster than my sister. But, I did it&#8211;something I’m much more glad about today than I was in October 2005. </p>
<p>And there’s a lesson from that day that I’ll be grateful for throughout the many more miles of training ahead, and that’s knowing that I can always push myself a little a bit further. If you set out for ten, 12+ won’t be a problem, and if you’ve run 12 before, 13 will be a breeze. Run 20 miles? Well then, of course you can run 26. Or at least I hope. </p>
<p>Running is all mental. And as I’m sure I’ll continue to express here, I play a lot of tricks on my brain to get out there and pound the pavement. When it’s 28 degrees outside and I delay, for as long as possible, heading on a 2+ hour run, the more encouragement I have the better. That’s always come from telling myself: you’ve done this, of course you can do it again. </p>
<p>Moving forward, I’ll need to slightly alter my strategy, and the memory of completing the Army 10-but actually 11.25-miler is a nice way to do so. Next weekend I’ll enter into more unknown territory, 13 miles, a distance I’ll certainly be ready for after 12.2. </p>

			<p>I’m not much of a treadmill runner. Although I occasionally enjoy being able to watch the news or thirty minutes of a bad movie I’d never see outside of <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com">Healthworks</a>, I still find it incredibly boring. I can’t help but look down at the time nearly every fifteen seconds or maintain a comfortable temperature, leaving me bright red, drenched in sweat, and a little more confused about the vampire/werewolf hype when I step off the treadmill. </p>
<p>This week has been a particularly cold one in Boston. Wednesday, at it’s peak, the temperature was 16 degrees. When the end of my workday rolled around, putting on my running gear was hard. Knowing I had 6 miles ahead of me, deciding whether to face the treadmill or pavement was even harder. </p>
<p>But when I thought about commuting 50 minutes to the gym and then sweating for an hour on the treadmill versus the bitter cold I would face while running directly home for an hour, it was an easy choice. On foot, I&#8217;d be done in 60 minutes. </p>
<p>I was one of four runners and two bikers on the Charles River Bike path between the Boston University Bridge and Mountain Auburn hospital that evening. Ordinarily when seeing runners out on such frigid days, all I can think is: why? Can’t you take a day off? But on Wednesday evening, I finally understood the answer. No, or at least not when you’re training for the Boston marathon in Boston. </p>
<p>Despite some discomfort to my face&#8211;my eyes, near frozen contact lenses, and chapped lips in particular, it really wasn’t so bad out there. After ten minutes, I wasn’t exactly warm but I wasn’t freezing, and for 2-3 miles my pace was 30 seconds to a minute faster than usual.  </p>
<p>Running in the bitter cold feels much better than waiting for a bus in it. More importantly, now that I’ve run an hour in the teens, I’ll be ready for 2 hours in the low twenties this weekend. </p>

<p>Sue, Paula, and I started this week’s Marathon Strong training session off by filling out our 2013 B.A.A. Boston Marathon registration forms, an exciting and surreal process. Since the entries are a pretty valuable commodity to come by, Lauren had given us specific instructions earlier in the week to fill the forms out perfectly. Thankfully we all completed them without any snafus, and we’re now officially committed to fundraising and running 26.2 miles for Healthworks Community Fitness! </p>
<p>During the training session Jason taught us a number of running drills to help us make our form and stride more efficient during the many miles ahead. After warming up with a few laps of lunges and karaokes, the first important step was setting our posture with knees slightly bent, hips forward, and hands above the head. The drills we learned were: hopping in place, to practice landing on the balls of our feet;  figure 4, pulling the foot up like it’s running along a rail on the other leg; and figure 4 at a pace of 180-190 beats per minute, landing as softly as possible. </p>
<p>After practicing them in place for a few minutes, we learned how easy moving forward actually feels thanks to gravity and a slight lean from the ankles. After two 5 minute circuits of combinations of lunges with a kettlebell, side planks, hopping in place, figure 4s, and karaokes, my heart rate was up and hamstrings were burning, all with good reason of course. Part of the lesson was also about getting us to reach a plateau and then recover&#8211;similar to how we’ll be feeling on and after Heartbreak Hill. </p>
<p>I was amazed during my five mile run the next evening when I could already feel how different my stride felt when I focused on the techniques we learned. My long run this weekend was just seven miles, which is recovery after nearly 10 last Sunday, with that and more drill practice I’ll be refreshed and ready for 12 next Saturday.</p>

<p>My marathon teammate Mike recently wrote a great reflective piece about his time spent coaching the running clinic and touring both Healthworks Community Fitness locations. It&#8217;s clear that the clubs and members left a strong impression on him, read his thoughts on his day at HCF on  <a href="http://betheredothat.hylands.com/one-day-in-dorcester/">Hyland&#8217;s Be Here, Do That blog</a>. </p>

			<p>Led by Back Bay personal trainer and HCF volunteer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a>, the HCF team is participating in Marathon Strong, a running-specific progressive group training program that focuses on injury prevention, increasing performance, and improving running form. </p>
<p>I used to be a regular “straight up strength” class attendee, but it’s likely been 6 months or so since I’ve attended one of Healthworks many challenging group fitness <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/group-fitness/">classes</a>. So after (what I now realize) was a fairly introductory small group training session last Thursday, week two was quite the challenge.  </p>
<p>We started with five minutes on the elliptical, the dynamic stretches we learned last week, and then jumped into a circuit program. My first stop was a plank, which I’m guessing was 60-90 seconds. From there it was a cable cross, working both sides of the core. The last, and my least favorite, stop was a two foot block, 15 pound weight, and a lot of stepping up, knee lifting, and burn. </p>
<p>After three rounds and a very brief break, we all kicked off the second circuit with two and half minutes of rotating between planks and side planks. My first stop was a balance/squat/core-cross-over-with-a-medicine-ball exercise. I then moved on to the TRX suspension training row, which involved pulling myself up with two feet on the ground from handles hanging from the ceiling, and quite a bit of soreness in my shoulders. And finally, dead lifts with a twenty pound medicine ball. Two rounds later, I was certainly tired, sweaty, and thankful that I was just another minute plank and handful of stretches away from being finished. </p>
<p>I walked down Boylston Street feeling energized, and woke up without too many sore muscles. But, since Marathon Strong&#8217;s a progressive training program, I might start fearing my Thursday evenings a tiny bit more.  </p>
