			<p>I couldn&#8217;t have thought of a better way to get my final 2 training miles in than at the HCF 5K this morning. Despite the cold weather&#8211;the temperature didn&#8217;t get above 40 degrees&#8211;an eager crowd still made it to the Hatchshell to get a 3 mile run, walk, or walk/run in. Seeing and feeling the enthusiasm among HCF members along the course and at the finish line was a joy.</p>
<p>It was also yet another reminder why Iâ€™m so proud to be running on the Healthworks Community Fitness Team, in support of an organization that means so much to me and so much to the women and children it helps lead healthier lives.</p>

			<p>After experiencing the joy of completing a 21 mile run two weeks ago, subsequent miles have been slightly underwhelming, and, physically and mentally, training has been a bit of a roller coaster. Throughout the entire training season, I&#8217;ve heard that once you reach 20 miles, you can go 26.</p>
<p>When I reached the top of Heartbreak Hill from Hopkinton just over two weeks ago, I was beyond thrilled, as well as relieved, confident that in another 3 weeks I&#8217;d be ready to complete the next 5 miles. Yet, as the memory of that day fades further away and the reality of the marathon comes closer, it&#8217;s been hard to keep creeping feelings of doubt and uncertainty at bay.</p>
<p>It was no surprise that just about every inch of my legs were sore or that I felt all around fatigued for a few days after 21. But my mind started to wander when I was winded after running a couple miles one day, my achilles suddenly swelled in pain shortly after that, and a severe head cold left me completely exhausted, and from running, for days.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve been trying not to speculate, it&#8217;s difficult not to rehash the training miles I&#8217;ve missed, the lousy 8 miles I ran on Saturday, or just how heavy my legs felt in Newton a few weeks ago and what that&#8217;ll all mean on Monday. At this point, it&#8217;s easy to get caught up in every single detail of the past 15 weeks and the next 7 days, but it&#8217;s not wise.</p>
<p>So what I keep reminding myself instead is that the gas is in the tank; I&#8217;ve logged the time and miles, what&#8217;s done is done. The only certainties are that there&#8217;s a marathon on Monday and that I&#8217;ll be at the starting line at 10:40. And the unknowns, when or how I get to the finish line, won&#8217;t happen or go well unless I believe I can make it there.</p>

			<p>I&#8217;m thrilled that I met my $5,000 fundraising goal this week! With 13 days to go, I&#8217;m eager to continue raising even more vital funds for Healthworks Community Fitness and reach the marathon team&#8217;s overall goal of $30,000. </p>
<p>Receiving a donation really is a huge boost of motivation and I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to everyone that&#8217;s taken the time to contribute and express their support. The dollars raised by the marathon team will be a very significant portion of the total donations that HCF receives this year, which is what makes being part of the <a href="http://www.johnhancock.com/bostonmarathon/bostonmarathon_nonprofit.html">John Hancock Non-Profit Marathon Program</a> such a big deal. </p>
<p>It also means that each donation has significant impact on HCF&#8217;s two Dorchester community fitness centers and numerous programs for the health and well-being of women and children in need. </p>
<p>As an advisory board member, I&#8217;m hopeful that this will be the first of many years in which HCF is granted numbers&#8211;I know I certainly couldn&#8217;t imagine a better organization to run and fundraise for!   </p>

<p>On Saturday, like hundreds of other runners, I was dropped off at the Boston Marathon starting line in Hopkinton and began my longest and most important run yet. After missing the 19 miler and weeks of knee and IT band pain, I was more than a little nervous about the very crucial 21 miles ahead. </p>
<p>Prior to boarding the busses to Hopkinton, Marathon Coalition coach Rick Muhr imparted some very useful <a href="http://bostonmarathoncoach.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/upcoming-boston-marathon-21-miler/">advice</a> on how to navigate the course&#8211;run the first 10K of mostly descending roads conservatively, find your rhythm between miles 10-15, take it easier on the Newton Hills from 16-21, and let your adrenaline + everything you&#8217;ve got left carry you to the finish line. Easy enough, right?</p>
<p>Pacing has been an issue for me all training season, starting every long run with miles a good 30 seconds faster than what I end with&#8211;a pattern that I really couldn&#8217;t afford to follow on my initial downhill miles if I wanted to make it to the last few uphill. </p>
<p>Fortunately, I was in excellent company from the starting line through Wellesley; running with my HCF teammate Sue not only kept my pace incredibly even, but made the time and miles fly by. From the beginning we agreed that neither of us were out to break any records, but that there were no hard feelings if she or I wanted to speed up, slow down, or put our headphones on. </p>
<p>At times, especially on the early descents when other runners were zipping by, I thought I wanted to speed up, but thanks to my even keeled running partner, I didn&#8217;t. And rather than thinking about how many miles I&#8217;d gone, or how many more were left, I enjoyed them.</p>
<p>Marathon Strong trainer Jason was at the 10K point in Framingham to cheer us on, and again four miles down the road in Natick along with HCF Executive Director Lauren, who jumped right in to run with us. A few quick miles later I was surprised to see that we were already making our way into Wellesley, the marathon&#8217;s halfway point, and a part of the course that Sue and I knew well by now.</p>
<p>Being able to recognize the course was both relieving, knowing that we were getting close, and intimidating, knowing the difficult stretches ahead. At mile 14, my legs were certainly feeling the effects of all those downhills and I knew it was time to slow down and say goodbye to Sue. Lauren kindly stayed with me just past the dreariest part of the course, mile 16, over Route 128, parting by reminding me just how little having 4+ miles left was when I had already made it so far. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say the rest of the way was a breeze or that I powered through every hill ahead&#8211;it wasn&#8217;t, and I walked up nearly every hill between miles 17-21. But, I can say that I felt pretty good, and, finally, ecstatic when I was met with cheers from 3 familiar faces at the day&#8217;s finish line, atop Heartbreak Hill.      </p>

			<p>After writing about making my amended <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/granola-bars-recipe/index.html">Alton Brown</a> granola bars last week, I figured I should include my own (nearly perfected) recipe. I&#8217;ll definitely be making and eating a batch of these before my 21 mile run on Saturday!</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">2 cups oats</span></li>
<li>2 cups mixed nuts (+ an optional dash of hemp or flax seeds)</li>
<li>1/4 cup honey</li>
<li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
<li>2-4 tbsp butter</li>
<li>1/3 cup almond or peanut butter</li>
<li>1 tbsp almond extract</li>
<li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 cup dried fruit</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-21.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-397" alt="granola 2" src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-21.jpg" width="470" height="470" /></a><br />
<strong>Method</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350. Butter <a href="http://localroot.com/USA-Pan-9-Square-Cake-Pan.html">9&#215;9-inch pan</a>.</li>
<li>Combine chopped nuts with oats, spread onto a cookie sheet and toast in oven for 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes or so.</li>
<li>Mix honey, brown sugar, butters, extract and salt in a saucepan over low-medium heat and cook until brown sugar has dissolved.</li>
<li>When the oats/nuts have toasted, remove and decrease the oven temperature to 300 degrees.</li>
<li>Combine oats/nuts with dried fruit and then add to the wet mixture, stirring until all dry ingredients are evenly coated. (I usually leave the heat on very low during this part and add extra butters and/or honey if neccesary.)</li>
<li>Spread mixture into buttered pan, pressing on it with a spatula to even it out. Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and allow bar to almost completelyÂ cool.</li>
<li>Cut into squares in the pan, or if you can get it out, remove the whole bar and cut it into squares on a cutting board.</li>
<li>Once the squares are completely cool, store them in an airtight container in the pantry or fridge for a week or so. If some (or all) of your bars crumbled, save that to top yogurt or ice cream, or to eat by the handful.</li>
</ol>

			<p>After 11 Marathon Strong sessions, it&#8217;s clear that the program has been invaluable to the HCF team&#8217;s overall success in training for Boston. We&#8217;ve not only learned A LOT about form and stride, warming up, stretching, foam rolling, and injuries, but have also been incredibly supported by <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/clubs/back-bay/">Healthworks Back Bay</a> personal trainer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a>. </p>
<p>Most training sessions have started with a round of 20 questions, which Jason has handled with quite a bit of patience toward the three of us first time marathon runners, he&#8217;s also given up many of his Saturday mornings to run with us and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.416246778465139.1073741827.104933796263107&amp;type=1/">provide water stops</a>, and most recently, has even offered to drop us off at the Boston Marathon starting line, which is in Hopkinton&#8211;26 miles away. (This would save us from boarding buses to Hopkinton in the Boston Common at 7:00am and waiting there until our 10:40am start time.)</p>
<p>At less than 5 weeks until the big day(!), now is the time when many first time marathon runners pick up a few injuries, me and the HCF team included. What I&#8217;ve realized over these last couple of weeks of particularly irritating knee/IT band pain is that without my team and trainer I&#8217;d be pretty discouraged and lost. There&#8217;s so much information about running out there, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to decipher. </p>
<p>After reading a few articles about IT bands the other night, I&#8217;d had enough, and couldn&#8217;t imagine having to rely on any of them for an answer or hint as to what the actual problem might be. I also realized, after reading bits from the comments sections, that my pain would be a whole lot worse without Marathon Strong. It seemed like many of the commentators didn&#8217;t really know the first thing about form, core strength, and stretching&#8211;things that I wouldn&#8217;t have a clue about either.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we&#8217;ve been working on each of these aspects progressively&#8211;each lunge, hip flexor stretch, plank, squat, 30 seconds of running in place, foam roll, and circuit, painful as certain segments has been, has had a pretty meaningful purpose. I&#8217;ve become more attuned than ever to how and why my legs are feeling a certain a way&#8211;and when I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m surrounded by a wealth of knowledge on the HCF team.</p>

<p>After a foot of snow was dumped on Boston on Thursday and Friday, 19 miles didn&#8217;t seem too promising this Saturday. Since Marathon Coalition&#8217;s planned Wellesley-Newton route has still had traces of Nemo during the last two weeks of running, with a fresh 12 inches we decided that the plowed Charles River Esplanade was a safer and more reliable option. Jason kindly met me, Sue, and fellow Marathon Strong trainee <a href= "http://rebeccarunsboston.wordpress.com">Rebecca</a> on the Cambridge side of the Mass. Ave. bridge at 9am yesterday morning to root us on and provide water stops throughout our 18 miler. </p>
<p>While the Esplanade wasn&#8217;t exactly free of snow, it was doable with caution and a slower pace. To my extreme disappointment, my left knee was in quite a bit of pain after just over 3 miles and, after conferring with the team at our first water stop, I decided to part ways for a very slow 2 miles home. </p>
<p>After spending some quality time with my IT band on the foam roller and ice on my knee, I got baking&#8211;if I couldn&#8217;t do the physical training, I could at least work on the nutritional part of it. </p>
<p>Over the last few months of a little trial and error while loosely following this <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/granola-bars-recipe/index.html">recipe</a>, I&#8217;ve nearly perfected homemade granola bars. My first few attempts left me with very few bars, but quite a bit of, still delicious, granola. </p>
<p>The game changer in texture has been the <a href="http://localroot.com/USA-Pan-9-Square-Cake-Pan.html">9&#215;9 USA Pan</a> I picked up at <a href="http://localroot.com">Local Root</a>, in taste, it&#8217;s been substituting vanilla extract for almond. I also use part almond butter, part stick. And though I usually use the cheap stuff from the bulk aisle, quality honey goes a long way. </p>
<p><a href="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-1.jpg"><img src="../../wp-content/uploads/2013/03/granola-1.jpg" alt="granola 1" width="470" height="470" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-362" /></a></p>
<p>I start by pulsing 2 cups of mixed nuts in a food processor. Add that to 2 cups of oats and bake at 350 for 15 minutes.</p>

<p>While the oat/nut mixture is in the oven, combine the butter, almond butter, honey, brown sugar, almond extract, and salt, slowly melting it on the stove. I don&#8217;t really follow Alton&#8217;s measurements with the wet ingredients, but eyeball it when it&#8217;s time to add the oats, nuts, and dried fruit. </p>
<p>Once the dry ingredients are evenly coated, press into a buttered pan, and bake at 300 for 25 minutes.</p>

<p>The tricky part is cutting, but I&#8217;ve recently found that getting the entire bar out of the pan while still slightly warm and then cutting has better results. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s amazing how much less expensive, more delicious and nutritious homemade granola bars are than what you find in boxes on grocery store shelves. They may not heal my knee, but, for now, they&#8217;ll help during the week of recovery ahead. </p>

Just when nearly all traces of Nemo had disappeared, I was more than disappointed to put on my snow boots this morning. After living in New England for 4 years, I&#8217;ve come to dread the month of February, which, after undergoing up to 4 months of rain, wind, freeze, and snow,  always feels like the longest, coldest, and most miserable month of the year. When it snows in March, it&#8217;s like winter is squeezing lemon on the wounds it inflicted December-February. Dramatic, yes, but from the sad looks on my fellow commuters faces this morning, it&#8217;s not that far from true. </p>
<p>Although it may not sound like it, I think I&#8217;ve handled the cold pretty well this year. But after hours of running in below freezing temperatures, snow, wind, and through ankle deep puddles, not to mention dealing with all of the above on a daily basis when I&#8217;m not running, I&#8217;ve had enough. I&#8217;ll manage on the short, leisurely run I planned on from work to Marathon Strong training at <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/clubs/back-bay/">Healthworks</a> tonight, it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/178937188">19 miles</a> of slippery sidewalks and roads I&#8217;ll be navigating on Saturday that I&#8217;m (even more) nervous about.   </p>

			<p>Itâ€™s hard to believe that there are less than 7 weeks until the Boston Marathon. I&#8217;ve come a long way since I <a href="../../index.html%3Fp=1.html">accepted</a> my spot on the Healthworks Community Fitness Marathon Team in November, but my stomach still does a flip when I think about how quickly April will arrive. </p>
<p>In December, I had more than a few sleepless nights thinking about <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/marisag/">fundraising</a> $5,000, and while I&#8217;m now sleeping much more soundly, it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m at ease with the amount of money I&#8217;ve raised (I&#8217;m not), but rather, because my body is just so tired. Day or night, much of my anxiety now comes from thinking about the actual marathon running. </p>
<p>Going from running 4 miles to 16 in just 11 weeks is a pretty good feeling, and thinking about that accomplishment keeps my hopes high for getting up to 26 miles over the next 6 weeks. As the long runs have increased, so have my feelings of bliss when I&#8217;ve completed them. But, that hasn&#8217;t come without a fair share of increasingly heavy legs, aches, and pains.</p>
<p>This week the HCF team ran 13 miles with Marathon Coalition, a recovery distance to get ready for the next push upward. I felt lighter all week knowing I&#8217;d only have to run a half marathon on Saturday morning, which is truly a thought I never saw coming and another reassuring indication of how I&#8217;ve far I&#8217;ve come.   </p>
<p>Before we headed out, MC <a href="http://bostonmarathoncoach.wordpress.com/about/">Coach Rick Muhr</a> reminded us of how little training time is left, just 2 more long runs (19 and 21 miles) before they taper, but that even when the distance decreases, every run counts until April 15. He said a lot of runners take the shorter runs too lightly, thinking <em>only</em> 13 miles and running them too quickly, which, after months of training, creates the perfect conditions for injury.</p>
<p>To my extreme surprise (and after adamantly thinking that&#8217;s not me during Rick&#8217;s talk), I fell right into that trap today and averaged a pace a good 20-25 seconds faster than any other of my long runs. I&#8217;m crediting that to the fact that it was the warmest (40 degrees), sunniest, and all around most pleasant Saturday morning I&#8217;ve run on, but, I&#8217;ve learned my lesson. </p>

<p>After 13.25 miles of the same Wellesley Hills we ran last week, I was far more red-faced, achy, and tired than I&#8217;ve been in weeks prior&#8211;a feeling I haven&#8217;t quite kicked all day. The bliss of being done has been subdued by a bothersome left knee and quick realization that 19 miles is less than a week away. Thankfully, I have a foam roller, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GLrKr54yA0/">advice</a> from <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a>, and ample reason to get some serious mental and physical rest before next Saturday. </p>

HCF ED <a href="http://healthworkscommunityfitness.org/staff">Lauren Broadhurst</a> and Marathon Strong trainer <a href="http://www.healthworksfitness.com/back-bay-trainers/">Jason Sibley-Liddle</a> kindly attended this Saturdayâ€™s 8am Marathon Coalition training to run with and cheer on me and <a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/paulasandler">Paula</a>. (<a href="http://www.crowdrise.com/TeamHealthworks/fundraiser/suehill">Sue</a> took the weekend off to give her achy knee a break.) The MC had an 18 mile route mapped out, which was, thankfully, very straightforward since the four of us were all planning on going different lengths.</p>
<p>Paula, fresh off the plane from a business trip in Japan, was running 13; Jason, a day before running the Hyannis Half Marathon was going out for 8; Lauren, who hadnâ€™t run in a few months, didnâ€™t have an exact number in mind; and I was running 16, the furthest Iâ€™ve ever gone.</p>
<p>Since Iâ€™ve been starting my long runs with miles nearly 2 minutes faster than Iâ€™ve been ending them with, I felt like I really needed to work on pacing. Lauren, who once ran 4 marathons in 9 months, agreed and urged me to get into the habit of starting off much more slowly. Lucky for me, she also volunteered to pace me.</p>
<p>We started just near the base of Heartbreak Hill, reversing the course and running west, away from Boston. Lauren ran with me for the first 6 miles, keeping me right on pace at hour 1, and, more importantly, concentrated on conversation rather than time and distance.</p>
<p>After running so many miles solo, talking while running was a bit challenging, but also tremendously helpful. She said my marathon pace shouldnâ€™t be faster than what I can hold a conversation at, and though Iâ€™m not convinced I couldâ€™ve held one from miles 10-16, I am sure that the first 6 miles of talking really helped me get through the last 6. Itâ€™s amazing how a little distraction for an hour can keep you going for another hour and forty.</p>
<p>Between yesterday and last weekend, Iâ€™ve now run nearly 10 miles of the course. 3 have been in reverse, but the other 7 have been eye opening. From what Iâ€™ve seen and felt so far, Heartbreak Hill is not the only heartbreaker on the course.</p>
