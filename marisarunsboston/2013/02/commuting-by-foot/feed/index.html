		<description><![CDATA[Great post!  I started the same way.  I was without a car and tired of the loooong bus-to-train commute.  So I figured I would give running to work a shot.  And, four years later, I&#039;m still doing it.  Thankfully, we don&#039;t have to deal with all that snow down here in Georgia.  :o)  

I reposted your piece on our Facebook page.  Stop by and check the site out (www.theruncommuter.com) if you have any questions or want some ideas on making your run commute even better.
